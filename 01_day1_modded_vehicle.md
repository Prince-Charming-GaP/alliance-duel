**[‚Üê Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)**

---

Monday is **Day 1: Modded Vehicle Boost**. This is GOLDEN WRENCH DAY - when we use all saved vehicle resources. If you've been hoarding golden wrenches all week, monday is payday!

## What Gives Points on Day 1

### üî• HIGH VALUE
1. **Golden Wrenches** - 5,000 base points (18,400+ with full research!)
2. **Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 5)** - 40,500 points each
3. **Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 4)** - 13,500 points each
4. **Radar Events** - 5,000 points per completion
5. **Level 9-10 Boomer Rallies** - 2,000 points per kill
6. **Modification Blueprints** - 20 points per blueprint consumed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM VALUE
- Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 3) - 4,500 points
- Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 2) - 1,500 points
- Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 1) - 500 points

### ‚ùå DON'T WASTE TIME ON
- **Creep kills** - 80-800 points (plus healing costs!)
- **Resource gathering** - 1-3 points per 1,000 resources

## Your Day 1 Action Plan

### BEFORE modded vehicle day start:
- [ ] Save ALL golden wrenches
- [ ] Save ALL vehicle component boxes (Level 1-5)
- [ ] Save ALL chip chests (green, blue, purple and yellow)
- [ ] Save ALL modification blueprints (don't use yet!)
- [ ] Stack radar events to 1 below your maximum capacity (e.g., 34/35, 39/40, 49/50) - Make sure you don't stack more, because it'll make you lose missions. Your maximum capacity depends on your radar building level (ranges from ~10 at level 1 to 50+ at higher levels)

### STARTING 0:00 am Server Time:
1. **WAIT 5 MINUTES!** (0:00-0:05 am server time is preparation period - nothing counts!)
2. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (8:00-12:00 or 20:00-24:00 Server Time)
3. **Use ALL golden wrenches** during Golden Hour
4. **Open ALL vehicle component boxes** (Level 5 first, then 4, 3, 2, 1)
5. **Open ALL chip chests**
6. **Complete ALL radar events** (5,000 points each)
7. **Join Level 9-10 boomer rallies** (NOT Level 1-8!)
8. **Consume modification blueprints**
9. **Collect resource gathering trucks** (if you started them earlier)

## Boomer Rally Strategy

**IMPORTANT: Level 9-10 give BETTER points despite "Certain Defeat" warning!**

The point structure:
- Level 1-2: 1,200 points
- Level 3-4: 1,300 points
- Level 5-6: 1,400 points
- Level 7-8: 1,600 points
- **Level 9-10: 2,000 points** ‚Üê TARGET THESE!

Don't let the "Certain Defeat" warning fool you - that's for solo attacks. With alliance rallies, you'll succeed AND get the best points.

## Golden Hour Timing

**Guaranteed Golden Hours (when Full Preparedness overlaps):**
- **Morning window:** 8:00-12:00 Server Time
- **Evening window:** 20:00-24:00 Server Time (last window before reset)

These windows ALWAYS match Day 1 theme! During Golden Hour, your actions count for BOTH events - Alliance Duel points + Full Preparedness rewards!

## What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches before 0:05am** - Preparation period = 0 points!
- ‚ùå **DON'T waste time on creep kills** - 80-800 points isn't worth the healing
- ‚ùå **DON'T gather resources for this event** - 1-3 points per 1,000 is terrible
- ‚ùå **DON'T rally Level 1-8 boomers** - Same gas cost, 400-800 fewer points
- ‚ùå **DON'T use construction speedups** - Save for Day 2!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use research speedups** - Save for Day 3!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use hero fragments** - Save for Day 4!

## Component Box Priority

Open in this order for maximum points:
1. **Level 5 boxes** - 40,500 points each (81x more than Level 1!)
2. **Level 4 boxes** - 13,500 points each
3. **Level 3 boxes** - 4,500 points each
4. **Level 2 boxes** - 1,500 points each
5. **Level 1 boxes** - 500 points each

After opening, upgrade the components for additional points!

## Chip chest Priority

Open in this order for maximum points:
1. **Yellow chests**
2. **Purple chests**
3. **Blue chests**
4. **Green chests**

After opening, upgrade the chips for additional points!

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 1,500,000 - 2,500,000 points
- **Top performers:** 3,000,000+ points
- **MVP candidates:** 5,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** How many golden wrenches you saved! With research, just 50 wrenches = 920,000 points.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using wrenches before event starts** - You get ZERO points!
2. **Not waiting for the 5-minute preparation period** - Nothing before 0:05am counts
3. **Killing creeps for points** - Waste of troops and healing resources
4. **Rallying low-level boomers** - Level 1-8 give 400-800 fewer points for same gas
5. **Not waiting for Golden Hour** - Missing double rewards from Full Preparedness
6. **Using vehicle resources on other days** - Day 1 is the ONLY day they give points

## Alliance Coordination

- Help teammates with radar events if nearby
- Share when you're starting a boomer rally and have trouble making it
- Enable auto-join for boomer rallies
- Coordinate Golden Hour activities for maximum impact

## The Research Reality Check

**Don't have Event Expert/Event King researched?**

You're leaving MASSIVE points on the table:
- Without research: 1 golden wrench = 5,000 points
- With research: 1 golden wrench = 18,400 points

That's 13,400 extra points PER WRENCH! Make Alliance Recognition research your priority on Day 3 when badge consumption gives points.

**That's a 3.68x multiplier!** If you haven't researched Event Expert and Event King yet, make it your priority.

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Things to use:**
- ‚úÖ ALL golden wrenches
- ‚úÖ ALL vehicle component boxes
- ‚úÖ ALL modification blueprints
- ‚úÖ ALL radar events
- ‚úÖ Level 9-10 boomer rallies (NOT 1-8!)

**Things to save:**
- üíæ Construction speedups (Day 2)
- üíæ Research speedups and badges (Day 3)
- üíæ Hero fragments (Day 4)
- üíæ Training speedups (Day 5)

## Final Conclusion

This is considered the easiest and most rewarding day - if you've saved your golden wrenches, you're already set for success!

Don't overthink it. Just use ALL your vehicle resources during Golden Hour and avoid everything else. Let's dominate!
