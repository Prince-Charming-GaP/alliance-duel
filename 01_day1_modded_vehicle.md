# Alliance Duel - Day 1: Modded Vehicle Boost (Golden Wrenches Day!)

**[‚Üê Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)**

---

Monday is **Day 1: Modded Vehicle Boost**. This is GOLDEN WRENCH DAY - when we use all saved vehicle resources. If you've been hoarding golden wrenches all week, monday is payday!

## What Gives Points on Day 1

### üî• HIGH VALUE
1. **Golden Wrenches** - 5,000 base points (18,400+ with full research!)
2. **Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 5)** - 40,500 points each
3. **Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 4)** - 13,500 points each
4. **Radar Events** - 5,000 points per completion
5. **Level 9-10 Boomer Rallies** - 2,000 points per kill
6. **Modification Blueprints** - 20 points per blueprint consumed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM VALUE
- Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 3) - 4,500 points
- Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 2) - 1,500 points
- Vehicle Component Boxes (Level 1) - 500 points

### ‚ùå DON'T WASTE TIME ON
- **Creep kills** - 80-800 points (plus healing costs!)
- **Resource gathering** - 1-3 points per 1,000 resources

## Week-Long Preparation Strategy

Day 1 success depends entirely on what you save throughout the previous week. Here's your preparation game plan:

### What to Save All Week:

**Sunday through Sunday (The Entire Week):**
- DO NOT use golden wrenches outside of Alliance Duel Day 1
- DO NOT open vehicle component boxes (save all levels 1-5)
- DO NOT open chip chests (green, blue, purple, yellow)
- DO NOT consume modification blueprints for upgrades
- DO complete radar events, but DON'T claim them yet - stack to 1 below max capacity
- DO participate in boomer rallies during the week for practice

**Why This Matters:**

If you use 1 golden wrench on Thursday:
- You upgrade your vehicle
- You get 0 Alliance Duel points
- You improve your vehicle (good, but...)

If you wait and use that same golden wrench on Day 1:
- You upgrade your vehicle the same amount
- You get 18,400 Alliance Duel points (with full research!)
- **Same upgrade, massive bonus points!**

**The Golden Rule:** Golden wrenches and vehicle resources should ONLY be used on Day 1 during Alliance Duel. There is no benefit to using them early.

### Radar Event Stacking Strategy:

**Throughout the Week:**
1. Complete radar events as they appear
2. DON'T click "Claim Reward" - let them stack
3. Stack to 1 below your maximum (34/35, 39/40, 49/50 depending on radar building level)
4. Stop at 1 below max to avoid losing new radar events
5. On Day 1, claim ALL stacked rewards during Golden Hour (5,000 points each!)

**Example:** If you stack 34 radar events throughout the week:
- 34 events √ó 5,000 points = 170,000 points on Day 1
- All from events you would complete anyway!

### Component Box Collection:

**All Week Long:**
- Collect component boxes from events, missions, shop
- Higher level boxes = exponentially more points (Level 5 = 40,500 points!)
- Don't be tempted to open them early - the wait is worth it
- Store them all for Day 1 mass opening

**Pro Tip:** Buy component boxes from alliance shop if available - they're worth far more on Day 1 than their cost.

### Super Upgrade Buff Planning:

**If You're Close to Unlocking Hercules/Destroyer/Destroyer EX:**

1. Throughout the week: Save 150,000+ modification blueprints
2. Get within 1-2 upgrades of unlocking the major tank
3. DON'T complete the final unlock until Day 1
4. Wait for Alliance Duel Day 1 to start
5. Unlock during Golden Hour and activate the 30-minute Super Upgrade Buff
6. Consume all 150k blueprints during the buff (20 points each = 3,000,000 points!)
7. This timing gives you both Alliance Duel points AND Full Preparedness rewards

**This is a once-per-tank opportunity - timing it right can add 3+ million points to your Day 1 score!**

### Pre-Event Checklist:

**Sunday Evening (Night Before Day 1):**
- Count your golden wrenches (this predicts your Day 1 score)
- Verify radar events are stacked to 1 below max
- Count component boxes by level
- Check modification blueprint count
- Join alliance chat to coordinate with teammates
- Set alarm for Golden Hour if needed

**Remember:** Day 1 is the easiest high-scoring day IF you prepared all week. No preparation = no points!

## Your Day 1 Action Plan

### BEFORE modded vehicle day start:
- [ ] Save ALL golden wrenches
- [ ] Save ALL vehicle component boxes (Level 1-5)
- [ ] Save ALL chip chests (green, blue, purple and yellow)
- [ ] Save ALL modification blueprints (don't use yet!)
- [ ] Stack radar events to 1 below your maximum capacity (e.g., 34/35, 39/40, 49/50) - Make sure you don't stack more, because it'll make you lose missions. Your maximum capacity depends on your radar building level (ranges from ~10 at level 1 to 50+ at higher levels)

### STARTING 0:00 am Server Time:
1. **WAIT 5 MINUTES!** (0:00-0:05 am server time is preparation period - nothing counts!)
2. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (8:00-12:00 or 20:00-24:00 Server Time)
3. **Use ALL golden wrenches** during Golden Hour
4. **Open ALL vehicle component boxes** (Level 5 first, then 4, 3, 2, 1)
5. **Open ALL chip chests**
6. **Complete ALL radar events** (5,000 points each)
7. **Join Level 9-10 boomer rallies** (NOT Level 1-8!)
8. **Consume modification blueprints**
9. **Collect resource gathering trucks** (if you started them earlier)

## Boomer Rally Strategy

**IMPORTANT: Level 9-10 give BETTER points despite "Certain Defeat" warning!**

The point structure:
- Level 1-2: 1,200 points
- Level 3-4: 1,300 points
- Level 5-6: 1,400 points
- Level 7-8: 1,600 points
- **Level 9-10: 2,000 points** ‚Üê TARGET THESE!

Don't let the "Certain Defeat" warning fool you - that's for solo attacks. With alliance rallies, you'll succeed AND get the best points.

## Golden Hour Timing

**Guaranteed Golden Hours (when Full Preparedness overlaps):**
- **Morning window:** 8:00-12:00 Server Time
- **Evening window:** 20:00-24:00 Server Time (last window before reset)

These windows ALWAYS match Day 1 theme! During Golden Hour, your actions count for BOTH events - Alliance Duel points + Full Preparedness rewards!

## What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches before 0:05am** - Preparation period = 0 points!
- ‚ùå **DON'T waste time on creep kills** - 80-800 points isn't worth the healing
- ‚ùå **DON'T gather resources for this event** - 1-3 points per 1,000 is terrible
- ‚ùå **DON'T rally Level 1-8 boomers** - Same gas cost, 400-800 fewer points
- ‚ùå **DON'T use construction speedups** - Save for Day 2!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use research speedups** - Save for Day 3!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use hero fragments** - Save for Day 4!

## Component Box Priority

Open in this order for maximum points:
1. **Level 5 boxes** - 40,500 points each (81x more than Level 1!)
2. **Level 4 boxes** - 13,500 points each
3. **Level 3 boxes** - 4,500 points each
4. **Level 2 boxes** - 1,500 points each
5. **Level 1 boxes** - 500 points each

After opening, upgrade the components for additional points!

## Chip chest Priority

Open in this order for maximum points:
1. **Yellow chests**
2. **Purple chests**
3. **Blue chests**
4. **Green chests**

After opening, upgrade the chips for additional points!

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 1,500,000 - 2,500,000 points
- **Top performers:** 3,000,000+ points
- **MVP candidates:** 5,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** How many golden wrenches you saved! With research, just 50 wrenches = 920,000 points.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using wrenches before event starts** - You get ZERO points!
2. **Not waiting for the 5-minute preparation period** - Nothing before 0:05am counts
3. **Killing creeps for points** - Waste of troops and healing resources
4. **Rallying low-level boomers** - Level 1-8 give 400-800 fewer points for same gas
5. **Not waiting for Golden Hour** - Missing double rewards from Full Preparedness
6. **Using vehicle resources on other days** - Day 1 is the ONLY day they give points

## Alliance Coordination

- Help teammates with radar events if nearby
- Share when you're starting a boomer rally and have trouble making it
- Enable auto-join for boomer rallies
- Coordinate Golden Hour activities for maximum impact

## The Research Reality Check

**Don't have Event Expert/Event King researched?**

You're leaving MASSIVE points on the table:
- Without research: 1 golden wrench = 5,000 points
- With research: 1 golden wrench = 18,400 points

That's 13,400 extra points PER WRENCH! Make Alliance Recognition research your priority on Day 3 when badge consumption gives points.

**That's a 3.68x multiplier!** If you haven't researched Event Expert and Event King yet, make it your priority.

## Vehicle Modification Rating & Super Upgrade Buffs

### Modification Rating Levels
As you upgrade your vehicles, you progress through modification rating levels:
- Intern
- Novice
- Veteran
- Elite
- Expert
- Master
- Grandmaster
- Modding Overlord

**Each rating level provides permanent perks**, such as:
- 50% cheaper upgrades (permanent cost reduction)
- Higher points per golden wrench during Alliance Duel
- Other bonuses that stack as you progress

### Super Upgrade Buff - GAME CHANGING for Maximum Scoring!

When you unlock certain **major tanks** (Hercules, Destroyer, Destroyer EX), you get access to a **Super Upgrade Buff** - a ONE-TIME, 30-minute buff where blueprint experience is **DOUBLED**!

**CRITICAL STRATEGY:**
- Save ~150,000 modification blueprints BEFORE unlocking these major tanks
- Activate the buff during **Golden Hour** (8:00-12:00 or 20:00-24:00 Server Time on Day 1)
- Use ALL your blueprints during the 30-minute buff window
- Blueprint usage during Golden Hour counts for BOTH Alliance Duel AND Full Preparedness!
- Continue using golden wrenches for rest of Golden Hour with your new higher modification level
- One player jumped from level 100 to 124 using 150k blueprints during this buff!

**Important Notes:**
- The buff appears when unlocking: **Hercules**, **Destroyer**, or **Destroyer EX**
- A blinking icon appears in upper-left corner - you must CLICK it to activate
- Don't click the icon until you're ready with 150k+ blueprints!
- The 30-minute timer starts when YOU activate it, so timing is critical
- This is likely a ONE-TIME buff per major tank unlock

### Why This Matters for Day 1:
- Higher modification level = significantly more points per golden wrench
- The 30-minute buff lets you jump 20+ levels instantly
- Combining high modification level + Event Expert/Event King research = maximum Day 1 scoring
- This is why experienced players save 150k+ blueprints for these tank unlocks

**Recommended Timing:**
1. Save 150,000+ modification blueprints
2. Work toward unlocking Hercules/Destroyer/Destroyer EX (but don't unlock yet!)
3. Wait for Alliance Duel Day 1 to start
4. Wait for Golden Hour (8:00-12:00 or 20:00-24:00 Server Time)
5. Unlock the tank and immediately activate Super Upgrade Buff
6. Use all 150k blueprints in the 30-minute window (counts for both events!)
7. Continue using golden wrenches for rest of Golden Hour with your new higher rating level

**This is a ONCE PER TANK buff - don't waste it! Time it for Golden Hour on Day 1 for maximum points!**
