**[‚Üê Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)** | **[‚Üê Day 3: Age of Science](03_day3_age_of_science.md)**

---

Thursday is **Day 4: Hero Initiative** - the day dedicated to hero progression! This is HERO DAY - when you use all saved hero fragments, recruitment tickets, power cores, and equipment materials. If you've been hoarding hero resources all week, this is when they pay off!

## What Gives Points on Day 4

### üî• HIGH VALUE
1. **Orange Hero Fragments** - 5,000 points each
2. **Orange Exclusive Equipment Fragments** - 5,000 points each
3. **Prime Recruitment Tickets** - 500 points each
4. **Power Cores** - 400 points each
5. **Enhancement Alloy** - Points for upgrading orange equipment
6. **Orange Skill Books** - 10 points per book consumed
7. **Hero Experience Consumption** - Points for leveling heroes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM/LOW VALUE
- Purple Hero Fragments - 1,700 points each
- Blue Hero Fragments - 500 points each
- Purple Exclusive Equipment Fragments - 1,700 points each
- Blue Exclusive Equipment Fragments - 500 points each

### ‚ùå NO VALUE / DON'T DO THIS
- **Purple or Blue Equipment Consumption** (as promotional material) - **0 POINTS**
- **Consuming Orange Equipment as Promotional Material** - 300,000 points BUT terrible long-term value!

## Week-Long Preparation Strategy

Day 4 success requires discipline throughout the week. Here's your preparation plan:

### What to Do Before Day 4:

**Monday - Wednesday (Days 1-3):**
- DO NOT use hero fragments (orange, purple, or blue)
- DO NOT use exclusive equipment fragments
- DO NOT use prime recruitment tickets
- DO NOT consume power cores
- DO NOT use Enhancement Alloy
- DO NOT level up heroes with experience items
- Save ALL skill books
- Collect hero resources from daily tasks, events, and mission rewards
- Note which heroes need upgrades

**Why This Matters:**

If you use 50 orange hero fragments on Monday:
- You upgrade your heroes (good!)
- You get 0 Alliance Duel points

If you wait and use them on Day 4:
- You upgrade the same heroes
- You get 250,000 Alliance Duel points
- **Same progression, massive bonus points!**

**The Golden Rule:** Any hero-related resource consumption should ONLY be done on Day 4 during Alliance Duel.

## The Hero Fragment Strategy

**Orange fragments are worth 10x blue fragments!**

### Point Comparison:
- 1 Orange hero fragment = 5,000 points
- 1 Purple hero fragment = 1,700 points
- 1 Blue hero fragment = 500 points

**Strategy: Save ALL hero fragments all week, use them ALL on Day 4!**

This includes:
- Hero fragments from any source
- Exclusive equipment fragments
- Universal fragments
- All rarity levels

Whether you use them on Monday or Thursday doesn't change your hero progression, but using them on Day 4 gives you massive free points!

## Exclusive Equipment Fragment Strategy

**Same principle as hero fragments:**

- Orange exclusive equipment fragment = 5,000 points
- Purple exclusive equipment fragment = 1,700 points
- Blue exclusive equipment fragment = 500 points

### What to Do:
1. **Use ALL exclusive equipment fragments on Day 4** (not before!)
2. **Upgrade equipment during the event** (gets points!)
3. **Don't craft equipment before event starts** (lose points!)

### What NOT to Do:
**DON'T consume equipment as promotional material!**

**Critical distinction:**
- **Purple or blue equipment consumption** = **0 POINTS** (waste!)
- **Orange equipment consumption** = 300,000 points BUT terrible long-term value

Yes, consuming orange equipment gives 300,000 points. But you're destroying functional orange equipment that took months to acquire for a one-time point gain. Unless you have duplicate orange equipment you genuinely don't need, this is almost never worth it.

**Better strategy:** Use fragments and Enhancement Alloy to upgrade existing equipment instead.

## Prime Recruitment Tickets

**500 points per ticket = Free points for something you'd do anyway!**

- Save ALL prime recruitment tickets this week
- Use them ALL on Day 4
- Recruit during Golden Hour to potentially overlap with other events
- 20 tickets = 10,000 points automatically

Don't try to save tickets for "perfect" recruitment timing. The event points are worth more than waiting for specific heroes.

## Power Cores

**400 points per power core consumed!**

Power cores are used to promote orange equipment. If you have power cores saved:

1. Wait until Day 4 to use them
2. Use during Golden Hour when possible
3. Focus on equipment for heroes you actually use

**Power Cores vs. Enhancement Alloy:**
- **Power Cores** = Promote orange equipment (increases star rating)
- **Enhancement Alloy** = Enhance orange equipment (increases stats)
- Both give points on Day 4!

The points are a bonus for progression you'd do anyway!

## Enhancement Alloy

**Points awarded for enhancing orange equipment!**

Enhancement Alloy is used to upgrade the stats of orange equipment without promoting it to the next star level.

### Strategy:
1. Save Enhancement Alloy all week
2. On Day 4, enhance equipment during Golden Hour
3. Focus on equipment for heroes you actually use

**Pro Tip: 0.2 Stars Strategy**
- Upgrade each orange equipment piece to 0.2 stars first
- This gives solid stat boosts across all equipment
- Uses fewer resources per upgrade than pushing higher
- Better distribution of power gains

## Skill Books

**10 points per orange skill book consumed**

This is lower value than other activities, but if you have skill books to use:

1. Save them for Day 4
2. Use on heroes you actually use
3. Focus on higher-value activities first (fragments, tickets, cores)

Skill books should be your lower priority compared to fragments and tickets.

## Hero Experience Strategy

**Points awarded for consuming hero experience to level heroes**

Consuming 24 million hero experience typically unlocks all task chests, making this one of the easier days to complete.

### Strategy:
1. Save hero experience items all week
2. On Day 4, level up heroes during event
3. Focus on heroes you actually use
4. Don't waste experience on unused heroes just for points

**Pro Tip:** If you have heroes close to level thresholds, wait until Day 4 to push them over!

## Your Day 4 Action Plan

### BEFORE Day 4 Starts (Thursday 0:00 Server Time):
- [ ] Count your hero fragments (all rarities)
- [ ] Count your exclusive equipment fragments
- [ ] Count your prime recruitment tickets
- [ ] Count your power cores
- [ ] Count your Enhancement Alloy
- [ ] Check which heroes need leveling
- [ ] Ensure ALL hero resources are saved (don't use Wednesday night!)

### STARTING Day 4 (Thursday):
1. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (Around 8:00 Server Time or before reset)
2. **Use ALL hero fragments** (orange > purple > blue)
3. **Use ALL exclusive equipment fragments**
4. **Use ALL prime recruitment tickets**
5. **Use ALL power cores** (promote orange equipment)
6. **Use Enhancement Alloy** (enhance orange equipment)
7. **Consume hero experience** to level heroes
8. **Use skill books** (on heroes you use)
9. **Upgrade equipment** with fragments

## Golden Hour Timing

**Day 4 Golden Hours:**
- **First window:** Around 8:00 Server Time (morning)
- **Second window:** Around 6:30pm Server Time (before reset)

**Hero upgrades during Golden Hour = Alliance Duel points + potential Full Preparedness rewards!**

If Full Preparedness has hero-related tasks, you'll complete both simultaneously.

## What NOT to Do on Day 4

- ‚ùå **DON'T consume purple/blue equipment** - Gives 0 points!
- ‚ùå **DON'T consume orange equipment as promotional material** (unless you have genuine duplicates)
- ‚ùå **DON'T use construction speedups** - Day 2 only!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use research speedups** - Day 3 only!
- ‚ùå **DON'T train troops extensively** - Save for Day 5!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches** - Day 1 only!
- ‚ùå **DON'T level heroes before event starts** - You lose all points!

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 800,000 - 1,500,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 2,000,000 - 3,500,000 points
- **Top performers:** 4,000,000 - 6,000,000 points
- **MVP candidates:** 8,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** How many orange fragments you've saved! Just 50 orange hero fragments = 250,000 points.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using fragments before event starts** - Losing thousands of points per fragment
2. **Consuming purple/blue equipment** - Gives 0 points! Complete waste!
3. **Consuming valuable orange equipment** - 300k points isn't worth destroying good gear
4. **Not using Enhancement Alloy** - Missing easy points from equipment upgrades
5. **Not waiting for Golden Hour** - Missing potential double rewards
6. **Upgrading heroes on wrong days** - Day 4 is the ONLY day that counts
7. **Wasting resources on unused heroes** - Focus on heroes you actually use

## The Fragment Hoarding Reality

**"How many fragments should I have saved?"**

Any amount helps! Here's the math:

**Small savings (50 orange fragments):**
- 50 √ó 5,000 points = 250,000 points
- Plus tickets, cores, and experience
- Easy to reach 500k-1M total

**Medium savings (150 orange fragments):**
- 150 √ó 5,000 points = 750,000 points
- Plus other activities
- Easily 1.5M-2M total

**Large savings (300+ orange fragments):**
- 300 √ó 5,000 points = 1,500,000 points
- Just from fragments!
- 3M+ total score achievable

Even if you only saved 20-30 fragments, that's still 100,000-150,000 free points!

## Priority Order for Day 4

**If you have limited time, prioritize in this order:**

1. **Orange hero fragments** (5,000 points each - highest value!)
2. **Orange exclusive equipment fragments** (5,000 points each)
3. **Prime recruitment tickets** (500 points each - quick and easy)
4. **Power cores** (400 points each - promote orange equipment)
5. **Enhancement Alloy** (enhance orange equipment)
6. **Purple fragments** (1,700 points each)
7. **Hero experience consumption** (level up heroes)
8. **Blue fragments** (500 points each)
9. **Skill books** (10 points each - lowest priority)

Focus on high-value activities first!

## Alliance Coordination

- Share major hero upgrades in chat (morale boost!)
- Celebrate when teammates unlock new heroes
- Help newer players understand fragment prioritization
- Coordinate Golden Hour timing for collective push

## The Equipment Consumption Decision

**"Should I consume my equipment for points?"**

**CRITICAL: Purple/Blue Equipment = 0 POINTS!**

Only consuming ORANGE equipment as promotional material gives points (300,000 base). Using purple or blue equipment for promotion gives **0 points** - it's a complete waste!

**"Should I consume my orange equipment for 300k points?"**

**Short answer: Almost never.**

**Only consume orange equipment if:**
- You have genuine duplicates (2+ of the same orange item)
- The equipment is for a hero you'll NEVER use
- You've carefully considered long-term vs. short-term value

**In 99% of cases:** Keep your orange equipment! The 300k points aren't worth months of lost functionality.

**Better alternatives:**
- Use exclusive equipment fragments instead (same progression, points without loss)
- Use Enhancement Alloy to upgrade equipment (gets points, keeps equipment)
- Focus on tickets and power cores (free points with no downside)
- Save equipment for actual use on your heroes

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Things to use on Day 4:**
- ‚úÖ ALL hero fragments (orange, purple, blue)
- ‚úÖ ALL exclusive equipment fragments
- ‚úÖ ALL prime recruitment tickets
- ‚úÖ ALL power cores (promote orange equipment)
- ‚úÖ ALL Enhancement Alloy (enhance orange equipment)
- ‚úÖ Hero experience items (to level heroes)

**Things to save:**
- üíæ Training speedups (Day 5)
- üíæ Combat resources (Day 6)
- üíæ Any speedups not yet used (Day 5)

## Final Reminder

**Day 4 = Hero Day = Fragment Day**

The strategy is simple:
1. **Save ALL hero-related resources all week**
2. **Use ALL of them on Day 4 during Golden Hour**
3. **Focus on orange fragments for maximum points**
4. **Use Enhancement Alloy and Power Cores to upgrade equipment**
5. **Don't consume purple/blue equipment (0 points!)**
6. **Don't destroy valuable orange equipment for points**

Whether you upgrade heroes on Monday or Thursday doesn't change your progression - but on Day 4 you get massive free rewards for the same actions!

This is one of the easier days to score well if you've been disciplined about saving fragments. Make those hoarded fragments count!
