Tuesday is **Day 2: Shelter Upgrade**. This is CONSTRUCTION DAY - when we use all saved building speedups and hunt for orange bounties. This day shows why "orange or nothing" is our motto.

## What Gives Points on Day 2

### üî• MASSIVE VALUE (Priority!)
1. **Orange Bounty Missions** - 60,000 base (111,000 with research!)
2. **Orange Refugees** - 40,000 base (107,000 with research!)
3. **Construction Speedups** - 107 points per 1-minute speedup + 3 points per 10 power consumed
4. **Building Upgrades** - Power gain + speedup consumption points

### ‚ö†Ô∏è LOWER VALUE
- Purple Refugees - 10,000 base (26,000 with research)
- Blue Refugees - 2,000 base (5,300 with research)
- Green Refugees - **0 POINTS** ‚ùå
- Green Bounties - **0 POINTS** ‚ùå

## Week-Long Preparation Strategy

Day 2 success requires careful planning and resource management throughout the week. Here's your preparation roadmap:

### What to Save All Week:

**Sunday through Monday (Before Day 2):**
- DO NOT use construction speedups outside of Alliance Duel Day 2
- DO NOT complete bounty missions if they're low tier (save refreshes for Day 2)
- DO NOT recruit refugees if they're low tier (save recruitment tickets)
- DO collect construction speedups from all sources (events, missions, shop, alliance help)
- DO plan which buildings you want to upgrade on Day 2
- DO save diamonds for bounty board and refugee refreshes

**Why This Matters:**

If you use 1,000 construction speedups on Sunday:
- You complete a building upgrade
- You get 0 Alliance Duel points
- You gain building power (good, but...)

If you wait and use those same 1,000 speedups on Day 2:
- You complete the same building upgrade
- You get 107,000 Alliance Duel points (1,000 min √ó 107 points)
- You gain the same building power
- **Same upgrade, 107,000 bonus points!**

**The Golden Rule:** Construction speedups should ONLY be used on Day 2 during Alliance Duel (or for urgent HQ upgrades). Save them!

### Building Upgrade Planning:

**Throughout the Week:**
1. Identify which buildings need upgrades (HQ, Training Camp, Research Lab priority)
2. Check resource requirements (wood, food, gas, metal)
3. Gather resources throughout the week
4. DON'T start the upgrades yet - wait for Day 2!
5. Request alliance help after starting upgrades on Day 2 (free speedups)

**Strategic Pre-Staging:**

**Monday Evening (Late Day 1):**
- Start expensive building upgrades (48+ hours)
- Let them run naturally through the night
- Finish them with speedups during Day 2 Golden Hour
- This gives you: speedup points + power points + Full Preparedness rewards

**Example:** Start HQ level 25 upgrade at 10pm Monday (72 hours). On Tuesday evening, speed it up during Golden Hour for massive points!

### Diamond Budget for Refreshing:

**Plan Your Diamond Investment:**

Day 2 is THE day to spend diamonds on refreshes. Here's why it's worth it:

**Bounty Board Refreshing:**
- Cost: ~100-200 diamonds per refresh
- Benefit: Orange bounty = 111,000 points
- ROI: Spending 500 diamonds to get 5 orange bounties = 555,000 points

**Refugee Refreshing:**
- Cost: ~100-300 diamonds per refresh (or trade "Try Your Luck" for new batch)
- Benefit: Orange refugee = 107,000 points
- ROI: Spending 300 diamonds for 3 orange refugees = 321,000 points

**Budget Recommendation:**
- Casual players: Save 500-1,000 diamonds for Day 2
- Competitive players: Save 1,000-2,000 diamonds for Day 2
- Top performers: Save 2,000+ diamonds (maximum refresh efficiency)

**Pro Tip:** Diamonds spent on Day 2 refreshes are worth MORE than most premium shop packs in terms of Alliance Duel points per diamond!

### Speedup Collection Strategy:

**All Week Long:**
- Complete daily missions (speedup rewards)
- Participate in alliance events (speedup prizes)
- Open speedup chests from mission rewards
- Buy speedups from alliance shop if affordable
- Request alliance help on ongoing upgrades (free speedups)
- DON'T use them until Day 2!

**Speedup Priority:**
1. Universal speedups (use on any construction)
2. Construction speedups (specifically for Day 2)
3. Alliance help (always free, request often)

### Bounty/Refugee Tracking:

**Monday (Day 1):**
- Check bounty board color distribution (but don't complete yet)
- Check refugee quality (but don't recruit yet)
- Note refresh costs
- Budget diamonds accordingly

**Pro Tip:** If you see orange bounties or refugees on Monday, it's okay to complete them IF you've already maxed out Day 1 vehicle activities. Don't waste good opportunities!

### Pre-Event Checklist:

**Monday Evening (Night Before Day 2):**
- Count your construction speedups (predicts your Day 2 score)
- Verify you have enough resources for planned building upgrades
- Check diamond balance for refreshing
- Review which buildings to upgrade (HQ, Training Camp, etc.)
- Identify any pre-staged upgrades that will finish on Day 2
- Join alliance chat to coordinate

**Pre-Staged Upgrade Tracking:**
- Building: HQ Level 25
- Started: Monday 10pm
- Natural completion: Thursday 10pm
- Plan: Speed up Tuesday 8pm Golden Hour
- Expected points: ~200,000+ (speedups + power gain)

**Remember:** Day 2 is "orange or nothing" day. Save speedups, save diamonds, and prepare to refresh until you see orange!

## The Orange Bounty Strategy

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF DAY 2!**

### The Brutal Math:
- 1 Orange bounty mission = 111,000 points (with research)
- 1 Green bounty mission = **0 points**
- 5 Orange bounties = ~805,000 points total

**Strategy: REFRESH until orange appears!**

1. Check your bounty board
2. If no orange missions ‚Üí **REFRESH** (costs diamonds, worth it!)
3. Keep refreshing until orange missions appear
4. Complete ONLY orange missions
5. Repeat throughout the day

Yes, this costs diamonds. Yes, it's 100% worth it. One orange bounty = more points than 100 green bounties.

## Construction Speedup Strategy

**Points Formula:**
- 107 points per 1-minute speedup used
- PLUS 3 points per 10 power consumed

**Research Boost:** If you have "Incentive - Development" researched in Alliance Recognition, you get an additional +100% bonus points for construction activities on Day 2!

### Optimal Approach:
1. **Wait for alliance "Help"** first (free speedups from teammates)
2. **Start major upgrades** (HQ, Training Camp, Research Lab)
3. **Use saved speedups** to complete during event
4. **Time it for Golden Hour** when possible

### Pro Tips:

**Tip 1 - Pre-Stage Upgrades:**
Start expensive upgrades on Day 1 or earlier so they naturally complete during Day 2. Or complete buildings but wait to click "Finish" until Day 2 starts. This lets you claim points immediately when the event begins!

**Tip 2 - Finish Ongoing Upgrades:**
If you started an expensive upgrade yesterday (late Day 1), finish it with speedups during Day 2 Golden Hour. You get:
- Speedup consumption points
- Power gain points
- Full Preparedness rewards (if Golden Hour)
- Your planned upgrade completed

**Same action, triple/quadruple benefit!**

## Refugee Recruitment Strategy

**Orange refugees ONLY!** Here's why:

- Orange refugee: 107,000 points (with research)
- Purple refugee: 26,000 points (with research)
- Blue refugee: 5,300 points (with research)
- Green refugee: **0 points**

### Recruitment Process & Costs:
1. Open Refugee Recruitment at the Bar
2. **First attempt:** 500 refugee tickets
3. **Second attempt (same pool):** 2,000 refugee tickets
4. **Third attempt (same pool):** 5,000 refugee tickets OR diamonds if you run out
5. **Refresh for new batch:** Costs diamonds but gives you a completely new selection

### Strategy:
- Use "Try Your Luck" once (500 tickets)
- If not orange ‚Üí **REFRESH for new batch** (diamonds) rather than re-rolling same pool
- Repeat until orange appears
- Recruit orange refugees only

**Important:** When a good refugee appears, grab it immediately even if it costs diamonds - good refugees are random and rare!

## Your Day 2 Action Plan

### BEFORE Day 2 starts:
- [ ] Save ALL construction speedups (don't use yet!)
- [ ] Identify which buildings you want to upgrade
- [ ] Check bounty board (but don't complete yet!)
- [ ] Count your available diamonds for refreshing
- [ ] Note your current building power

### STARTING 0:00 am Server Time:
1. **WAIT 5 MINUTES!** (0:00-0:05 am server time is preparation period - nothing counts!)
2. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (8:00-12:00 or 20:00-24:00 Server Time)
3. **Start major building upgrades** (HQ, Training Camp, etc.)
4. **Refresh bounty board until orange missions appear**
5. **Complete ONLY orange bounty missions**
6. **Use construction speedups** during Golden Hour
7. **Refresh refugee recruitment until orange refugees**
8. **Recruit ONLY orange refugees**

## Golden Hour Timing

**Guaranteed Golden Hours (when Full Preparedness overlaps):**
- **Morning window:** 8:00-12:00 Server Time
- **Evening window:** 20:00-24:00 Server Time (last window before reset)

These windows ALWAYS match Day 2 theme! **This is CRITICAL for Day 2!** Using speedups during Golden Hour means:
- Alliance Duel points
- Full Preparedness rewards
- Same resource expenditure, double rewards!

## Building Priority

If choosing which buildings to upgrade:

**Highest Priority:**
1. **HQ upgrades** - Unlocks everything, high power gain
2. **Training Camp** - Expensive, high power, needed for progression
3. **Research Lab** - High power, enables better research

**Medium Priority:**
4. Barracks/Ranges/Garage - Troop capacity and training
5. Hospital - Increased healing capacity
6. Wall upgrades - Defensive power

**Strategy:** Upgrade troop buildings before HQ when possible - they cost fewer speedups but give comparable power gains. This preserves speedups for future events.

## What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå **DON'T complete green/blue/purple bounties** - Wait for orange!
- ‚ùå **DON'T recruit green/blue/purple refugees** - Wait for orange!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use research speedups** - Save for Day 3!
- ‚ùå **DON'T spend hero fragments** - Save for Day 4!
- ‚ùå **DON'T train troops extensively** - Save for Day 5!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches** - Day 1 only!

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 800,000 - 1,500,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 2,200,000 - 3,500,000 points
- **Top performers:** 4,000,000 - 6,000,000 points
- **MVP candidates:** 6,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** Orange bounty completion! 5 orange bounties = 805,000 points automatically.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Completing non-orange bounties** - Literally worth 0 points
2. **Not refreshing for orange** - Missing hundreds of thousands of points
3. **Using speedups before event starts** - Zero points for same action
4. **Ignoring Golden Hour** - Missing Full Preparedness double rewards
5. **Recruiting non-orange refugees** - Massive point difference
6. **Being impatient with refreshing** - Spending 300 diamonds to get 500,000 extra points is a great trade!

## Alliance Coordination

- Click "Help Alliance" button to give free speedups to teammates
- Request help for your building upgrades to save speedups
- Share in chat when you find good bounty/refugee refreshes
- Coordinate major upgrades for alliance-wide morale

## The Diamond Investment Reality

**"But refreshing costs diamonds!"**

Yes, and it's absolutely worth it. Consider:

**Scenario A (No refreshing):**
- Complete 5 green bounties = 0 points
- Recruit 3 green refugees = 0 points
- Total: 0 points, 0 diamonds spent

**Scenario B (Refresh for orange):**
- Spend 500 diamonds refreshing
- Complete 5 orange bounties = 805,000 points
- Recruit 3 orange refugees = 321,000 points  
- Total: 1,126,000 points, 500 diamonds spent

**The math is clear:** Diamonds spent refreshing for orange is the single best point investment in Alliance Duel.

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Things to use on Day 2:**
- ‚úÖ ALL construction speedups
- ‚úÖ Building upgrade power
- ‚úÖ Orange bounty missions (refresh until orange!)
- ‚úÖ Orange refugee recruitment (refresh until orange!)

**Things to save:**
- üíæ Research speedups and badges (Day 3)
- üíæ Hero fragments and equipment (Day 4)
- üíæ Training speedups (Day 5)
- üíæ Combat resources (Day 6)

## Final Reminder

**Day 2 = Construction Day = Orange Bounty Day**

The key to massive Day 2 scores: **PATIENCE WITH REFRESHING**

Don't settle for green/blue/purple when orange exists. Refresh until orange appears, even if it costs diamonds. The point difference is so massive that refreshing is always worth it.

And remember: Use your speedups during Golden Hour to double-dip on rewards!

Let's build our way to victory! üèóÔ∏èüí™
