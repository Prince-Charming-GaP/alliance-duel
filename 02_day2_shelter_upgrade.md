# Alliance Duel - Day 2: Shelter Upgrade (Orange Bounties = HUGE Points!)

**[‚Üê Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)** | **[‚Üê Day 1: Modded Vehicle](01_day1_modded_vehicle.md)**

---

Tuesday is **Day 2: Shelter Upgrade**. This is CONSTRUCTION DAY - when we use all saved building speedups and hunt for orange bounties. This day shows why "orange or nothing" is our motto.

## What Gives Points on Day 2

### üî• MASSIVE VALUE (Priority!)
1. **Orange Bounty Missions** - 60,000 base (111,000 with research!)
2. **Orange Refugees** - 40,000 base (107,000 with research!)
3. **Construction Speedups** - 107 points per 1-minute speedup + 3 points per 10 power consumed
4. **Building Upgrades** - Power gain + speedup consumption points

### ‚ö†Ô∏è LOWER VALUE
- Purple Refugees - 10,000 base (26,000 with research)
- Blue Refugees - 2,000 base (5,300 with research)
- Green Refugees - **0 POINTS** ‚ùå
- Green Bounties - **0 POINTS** ‚ùå

## The Orange Bounty Strategy

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF DAY 2!**

### The Brutal Math:
- 1 Orange bounty mission = 111,000 points (with research)
- 1 Green bounty mission = **0 points**
- 5 Orange bounties = ~805,000 points total

**Strategy: REFRESH until orange appears!**

1. Check your bounty board
2. If no orange missions ‚Üí **REFRESH** (costs diamonds, worth it!)
3. Keep refreshing until orange missions appear
4. Complete ONLY orange missions
5. Repeat throughout the day

Yes, this costs diamonds. Yes, it's 100% worth it. One orange bounty = more points than 100 green bounties.

## Construction Speedup Strategy

**Points Formula:**
- 107 points per 1-minute speedup used
- PLUS 3 points per 10 power consumed

**Research Boost:** If you have "Incentive - Development" researched in Alliance Recognition, you get an additional +100% bonus points for construction activities on Day 2!

### Optimal Approach:
1. **Wait for alliance "Help"** first (free speedups from teammates)
2. **Start major upgrades** (HQ, Training Camp, Research Lab)
3. **Use saved speedups** to complete during event
4. **Time it for Golden Hour** when possible

### Pro Tips:

**Tip 1 - Pre-Stage Upgrades:**
Start expensive upgrades on Day 1 or earlier so they naturally complete during Day 2. Or complete buildings but wait to click "Finish" until Day 2 starts. This lets you claim points immediately when the event begins!

**Tip 2 - Finish Ongoing Upgrades:**
If you started an expensive upgrade yesterday (late Day 1), finish it with speedups during Day 2 Golden Hour. You get:
- Speedup consumption points
- Power gain points
- Full Preparedness rewards (if Golden Hour)
- Your planned upgrade completed

**Same action, triple/quadruple benefit!**

## Refugee Recruitment Strategy

**Orange refugees ONLY!** Here's why:

- Orange refugee: 107,000 points (with research)
- Purple refugee: 26,000 points (with research)
- Blue refugee: 5,300 points (with research)
- Green refugee: **0 points**

### Recruitment Process & Costs:
1. Open Refugee Recruitment at the Bar
2. **First attempt:** 500 refugee tickets
3. **Second attempt (same pool):** 2,000 refugee tickets
4. **Third attempt (same pool):** 5,000 refugee tickets OR diamonds if you run out
5. **Refresh for new batch:** Costs diamonds but gives you a completely new selection

### Strategy:
- Use "Try Your Luck" once (500 tickets)
- If not orange ‚Üí **REFRESH for new batch** (diamonds) rather than re-rolling same pool
- Repeat until orange appears
- Recruit orange refugees only

**Important:** When a good refugee appears, grab it immediately even if it costs diamonds - good refugees are random and rare!

## Your Day 2 Action Plan

### BEFORE Day 2 starts:
- [ ] Save ALL construction speedups (don't use yet!)
- [ ] Identify which buildings you want to upgrade
- [ ] Check bounty board (but don't complete yet!)
- [ ] Count your available diamonds for refreshing
- [ ] Note your current building power

### STARTING 0:00 am Server Time:
1. **WAIT 5 MINUTES!** (0:00-0:05 am server time is preparation period - nothing counts!)
2. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (8:00-12:00 or 20:00-24:00 Server Time)
3. **Start major building upgrades** (HQ, Training Camp, etc.)
4. **Refresh bounty board until orange missions appear**
5. **Complete ONLY orange bounty missions**
6. **Use construction speedups** during Golden Hour
7. **Refresh refugee recruitment until orange refugees**
8. **Recruit ONLY orange refugees**

## Golden Hour Timing

**Guaranteed Golden Hours (when Full Preparedness overlaps):**
- **Morning window:** 8:00-12:00 Server Time
- **Evening window:** 20:00-24:00 Server Time (last window before reset)

These windows ALWAYS match Day 2 theme! **This is CRITICAL for Day 2!** Using speedups during Golden Hour means:
- Alliance Duel points
- Full Preparedness rewards
- Same resource expenditure, double rewards!

## Building Priority

If choosing which buildings to upgrade:

**Highest Priority:**
1. **HQ upgrades** - Unlocks everything, high power gain
2. **Training Camp** - Expensive, high power, needed for progression
3. **Research Lab** - High power, enables better research

**Medium Priority:**
4. Barracks/Ranges/Garage - Troop capacity and training
5. Hospital - Increased healing capacity
6. Wall upgrades - Defensive power

**Strategy:** Upgrade troop buildings before HQ when possible - they cost fewer speedups but give comparable power gains. This preserves speedups for future events.

## What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå **DON'T complete green/blue/purple bounties** - Wait for orange!
- ‚ùå **DON'T recruit green/blue/purple refugees** - Wait for orange!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use research speedups** - Save for Day 3!
- ‚ùå **DON'T spend hero fragments** - Save for Day 4!
- ‚ùå **DON'T train troops extensively** - Save for Day 5!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches** - Day 1 only!

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 800,000 - 1,500,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 2,200,000 - 3,500,000 points
- **Top performers:** 4,000,000 - 6,000,000 points
- **MVP candidates:** 6,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** Orange bounty completion! 5 orange bounties = 805,000 points automatically.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Completing non-orange bounties** - Literally worth 0 points
2. **Not refreshing for orange** - Missing hundreds of thousands of points
3. **Using speedups before event starts** - Zero points for same action
4. **Ignoring Golden Hour** - Missing Full Preparedness double rewards
5. **Recruiting non-orange refugees** - Massive point difference
6. **Being impatient with refreshing** - Spending 300 diamonds to get 500,000 extra points is a great trade!

## Alliance Coordination

- Click "Help Alliance" button to give free speedups to teammates
- Request help for your building upgrades to save speedups
- Share in chat when you find good bounty/refugee refreshes
- Coordinate major upgrades for alliance-wide morale

## The Diamond Investment Reality

**"But refreshing costs diamonds!"**

Yes, and it's absolutely worth it. Consider:

**Scenario A (No refreshing):**
- Complete 5 green bounties = 0 points
- Recruit 3 green refugees = 0 points
- Total: 0 points, 0 diamonds spent

**Scenario B (Refresh for orange):**
- Spend 500 diamonds refreshing
- Complete 5 orange bounties = 805,000 points
- Recruit 3 orange refugees = 321,000 points  
- Total: 1,126,000 points, 500 diamonds spent

**The math is clear:** Diamonds spent refreshing for orange is the single best point investment in Alliance Duel.

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Things to use on Day 2:**
- ‚úÖ ALL construction speedups
- ‚úÖ Building upgrade power
- ‚úÖ Orange bounty missions (refresh until orange!)
- ‚úÖ Orange refugee recruitment (refresh until orange!)

**Things to save:**
- üíæ Research speedups and badges (Day 3)
- üíæ Hero fragments and equipment (Day 4)
- üíæ Training speedups (Day 5)
- üíæ Combat resources (Day 6)

## Final Reminder

**Day 2 = Construction Day = Orange Bounty Day**

The key to massive Day 2 scores: **PATIENCE WITH REFRESHING**

Don't settle for green/blue/purple when orange exists. Refresh until orange appears, even if it costs diamonds. The point difference is so massive that refreshing is always worth it.

And remember: Use your speedups during Golden Hour to double-dip on rewards!

Let's build our way to victory! üèóÔ∏èüí™
