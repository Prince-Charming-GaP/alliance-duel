Now that you understand each day's mechanics, this chapter covers the advanced strategies that separate top-performing alliances from the rest. These approaches require multi-week planning, coordination, and discipline - but they can easily double or triple your Alliance Duel effectiveness.

## The Focus Days Strategy

**The most effective alliances don't try to win every day - they coordinate to dominate specific days strategically.**

This is an **alliance-wide strategy** decided by leadership at the start of each week. All members follow the same focus days to concentrate the alliance's collective resources where they matter most.

### Understanding the 7-Point Win Condition:

Alliance Duel is won by earning **7 points across the week**. The point distribution is:

**The Math:**
- Day 1 (Modded Vehicle): 1 point
- Day 2 (Shelter Upgrade): 2 points
- Day 3 (Age of Science): 2 points
- Day 4 (Hero Initiative): 2 points
- Day 5 (Holistic Growth): 2 points
- Day 6 (Enemy Buster): 4 points
- **Total available:** 13 points
- **Needed to win:** 7 points

### The Strategic Implication:

**You don't need to win every day!** Multiple paths lead to 7 points:
- Win Day 6 (4pts) + any two of Days 2-5 (2pts each) = 8 points
- Win Day 6 (4pts) + Day 1 (1pt) + any one of Days 2-5 (2pts) = 7 points
- Win three of Days 2-5 (6pts) + Day 1 (1pt) = 7 points (no Day 6 needed!)

This flexibility enables **strategic resource allocation** rather than spreading thin across all days.

### The Focus Days Approach:

**Week 1 Focus Example:**
- **Days 2, 3, 6: FOCUS DAYS** - Alliance deploys all saved resources (trying to win these 3 days)
- **Days 1, 4, 5: SAVE DAYS** - Alliance saves saveable resources for next week
  - Still participate: Complete radar events (Day 1), train troops (Day 5), help alliance, etc.
  - Don't spend: Golden wrenches (Day 1), hero fragments (Day 4), trainable troop speedups (Day 5)
  - Goal: Unlock personal reward chests while preserving major resources
- **Target:** 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 points (secure win, preserving 60% of resources)

**Week 2 Focus Example:**
- **Days 1, 4, 5, 6: FOCUS DAYS** - Alliance deploys saved resources from Week 1 + current accumulation
- **Days 2, 3: SAVE DAYS** - Alliance saves building speedups (Day 2) and badges (Day 3) for Week 3
  - Still participate: Complete bounties, train troops, help alliance
  - Don't spend: Construction speedups, research badges, recruitment tickets
- **Target:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9 points (dominant win using saved + current resources)

### The Power of Two-Week Saving:

When you save resources for 2 weeks on specific days, you can score almost **double** when you finally deploy on that day!

**Example - Day 3 (Badge Day):**
- Normal week: 10,000 badges accumulated → 3-4M points
- Saved for 2 weeks: 20,000 badges accumulated → 7-8M points
- **Nearly double the score = dominating that day**

### Day 6 (Enemy Buster) Priority:

**Enemy Buster should be a focus EVERY week** because it's worth 4 points - nearly 1/3 of the total points available and more than half of what's needed to win!

However, at the **start of each week** you must evaluate:
- Can we realistically win Enemy Buster this week?
- Is the opponent too strong in combat?
- Do we have enough active combat players?
- What's the power differential?

**If yes (we can win Day 6):**
- Focus on Day 6 + just two of Days 2-5 = 8 points total (secure win)
- OR Day 6 + Day 1 + one of Days 2-5 = 7 points total (minimum win)

**If no (Day 6 unlikely):**
- Need to win Day 1 + all four of Days 2-5 = 9 points total (requires full effort on 5 days!)
- OR win three of Days 2-5 + Day 1 = 7 points (still requires 4-day focus)
- This is much harder - winning Day 6 makes everything easier!

### How Leadership Decides Which Days to Focus:

**There is NO fixed schema.** Alliance leadership evaluates each week based on:

**Alliance Strength:**
- Are we stronger at PvE tasks (Days 1-5) or PvP combat (Day 6)?
- Which members are most active this week?
- What's our collective resource stockpile?

**Opponent Analysis:**
- Which days do they typically score highest?
- Where are they vulnerable?
- Can we exploit specific weaknesses?

**Resource Availability:**
- What did the alliance save from last week?
- What are members' current stockpiles collectively?
- Which days can we realistically dominate together?

**Strategic Balance:**
- Don't focus the same 3 days every week
- Rotate focus to keep resources flowing
- Balance short-term wins with long-term resource management

### Communicating Focus Days:

**Alliance leadership should announce at week start:**

*"Focus Days this week: 3, 4, 6 (Target: 8 points for the win)*
- *Day 3: Spend ALL badges saved from last week*
- *Day 4: Deploy ALL hero fragments*
- *Day 6: Full combat participation*
- *Days 1, 2, 5: MINIMAL participation - save these resources for next week!"*

**This coordination is essential!** The strategy only works if the alliance moves together:
- 20 members focusing correctly = Massive day scores, likely win
- 10 members focusing, 10 ignoring = Wasted strategy, mediocre scores
- Clear communication at week start prevents confusion

### The Long-Term Alliance Mindset:

Advanced alliances think beyond the current week:
- "This week's opponent matchup and our focus days"
- "Next week's likely strategy based on saved resources"
- "Two-week resource accumulation advantage"
- "League season standing and promotion/demotion pressure"

**The alliance isn't playing one week at a time - it's managing a continuous strategic cycle where each week's decisions affect future weeks!**

### Key Principles for Save Days:

**What "Save Day" means:**
- **DO:** Complete activities that can't be saved (bounties, radar events, intercity trade, troop training)
- **DO:** Score enough points to unlock your personal reward chests
- **DON'T:** Spend major saveable resources (speedups, golden wrenches, hero fragments, badges)
- **Goal:** Maintain participation and earn chest rewards while preserving resources for focus days

**Example - Day 1 as a Save Day:**
- ✅ Complete stacked radar events (can't save these forever)
- ✅ Participate in boomer rallies (learn combat, earn points)
- ✅ Train troops if needed (unsaveable activity)
- ❌ Don't use golden wrenches (save for next time Day 1 is a focus day)
- ❌ Don't open vehicle component boxes (save for focus day)

This approach ensures members still progress personally and earn rewards while the alliance builds resource advantages for future weeks.

## The Competitive Weekly Cycle

**Advanced alliances and their members think in weekly cycles, not just event participation.**

Individual preparation combined with alliance coordination creates the foundation for Focus Days strategy success.

### The Weekly Rhythm:

**Sunday-Saturday (During Alliance Duel):**
- Execute saved resources on correct days
- Maximize scoring through timing and coordination
- Use Golden Hour windows religiously
- Focus on orange-tier activities only

**Sunday-Wednesday (Post-Event Recovery):**
- Analyze performance (what worked, what didn't)
- Start accumulating resources for next week
- Don't use theme-day resources (save them!)
- Progress normally but strategically

**Wednesday-Saturday (Pre-Event Preparation):**
- Accelerate resource accumulation
- Final hoarding push
- Verify research priorities
- Coordinate with alliance for next week

**Result:** You're ALWAYS in Alliance Duel mode - either participating or preparing!

## The Chinatsu Hero Investment

**Chinatsu provides a passive Alliance Duel point bonus through her "Samurai Spirit" skill.**

### The Bonus Scaling:

**Base Chinatsu (unlocked):**
- +25% Alliance Duel points on all activities

**Fully Upgraded Chinatsu (5-star):**
- Base: +25%
- Star upgrades: +2%, +3%, +3%, +5%, +7% (total +20%)
- **Maximum: +45% Alliance Duel points** on all activities

### The Impact:

**Without Chinatsu:**
- Your Day 1 score: 1,000,000 points

**With base Chinatsu (25%):**
- Your Day 1 score: 1,250,000 points
- +250,000 bonus points

**With fully upgraded Chinatsu (45%):**
- Your Day 1 score: 1,450,000 points
- +450,000 bonus points
- Same actions, 45% more points!

### The Investment Priority:

**Standard hero development priority:**
1. Combat heroes (required for progression)
2. Gathering heroes (daily resource value)
3. Development heroes (construction, research support)
4. Specialty heroes

**For competitive Alliance Duel players:**
- Chinatsu moves to priority #2 or even #1
- Weekly Alliance Duel value compounds over time
- The bonus applies to every action during the event

**Important:** Even base Chinatsu (25%) provides significant value. The 5-star upgrades take time but aren't required to benefit from the hero.

### The Compounding Effect:

Chinatsu stacks multiplicatively with research bonuses for massive point gains:

**50 golden wrenches with FULL bonuses:**
- Base: 250,000 points
- With Chinatsu (+45%): 362,500 points
- With Event Expert (+100%): 725,000 points
- With Event King (+200%): 1,087,500 points
- With Incentive - Vehicle (+100%): 1,450,000 points

**Same 50 wrenches: 250k vs 1.45M points = 5.8x multiplier!**

Chinatsu's bonus applies to EVERY Alliance Duel action across all 6 days, making the investment extremely valuable for competitive play.

## The Points Sprint - Double Points Final 10 Minutes

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** The final 10 minutes before daily reset (00:00 Server Time) grants **2x points for ALL Alliance Duel actions!**

This mechanic is not documented anywhere in-game and most players are unaware of it. However, competitive alliances use it strategically to swing close matches.

### How Points Sprint Works:

**Sprint Window:**
- **23:50-00:00 Server Time** (10 minutes before daily reset)
- ALL Alliance Duel actions earn **DOUBLE points**
- No visible multiplier indicator in-game
- Works every single day of Alliance Duel

**The Math:**
- 50 golden wrenches normally: 920,000 points (with research)
- Same 50 wrenches during sprint: **1,840,000 points**
- **920,000 bonus points just from timing!**

### Strategic Implementation:

**For Alliance-Wide Coordination:**

Alliance leadership should announce sprint strategy:
- Have members prepare resources before 23:50
- Coordinate who goes for rank 1 during sprint
- Focus highest-value quick actions during final 10 minutes

**Individual Sprint Strategy:**

1. **Resource Preparation (23:40-23:50):**
   - Have all resources ready to use
   - Open component boxes and prepare items
   - Don't start using until 23:50!

2. **Sprint Execution (23:50-00:00):**
   - Focus on QUICK actions only
   - Golden wrenches (instant)
   - Component boxes (instant)
   - Badges (instant)
   - Vehicle/equipment upgrades (instant start)
   - Avoid construction (takes time to start)

3. **Timing Critical:**
   - Set alarm for 23:45 to prepare
   - Watch server clock closely
   - Better 10 seconds late than 10 seconds early!

### Combining Sprint with Golden Hour:

The 20:00-24:00 Golden Hour window includes the sprint period!

**Optimal Strategy:**
- **20:00-23:50:** Use 70% of resources (Golden Hour rewards from both events)
- **23:50-00:00:** Use remaining 30% of BEST resources (2x Alliance Duel points + Full Preparedness)

**Example Split:**
- Use 35 golden wrenches during 20:00-23:50
- Save 15 BEST wrenches for 23:50-00:00 sprint
- Result: Maximize both Full Preparedness chests AND Alliance Duel sprint bonus

### Why This Decides Close Matches:

Many Alliance Duel weeks come down to narrow margins:
- Alliance scores: 48.2M vs 47.8M (400k difference)
- One player using sprint: +920k bonus from 50 wrenches
- **Sprint usage can single-handedly swing victories**

**Common Scenario:**
- You're monitoring opponent score throughout day
- Match is close at 23:40
- You deploy sprint strategy at 23:50
- Opponent doesn't know about sprint
- You win by 500k-1M points

### Alliance Communication:

**Leadership should announce:**
- "Today is focus day - everyone save resources for 23:50 sprint"
- "If competing for rank 1, coordinate sprint timing"
- "Watch server clock - 23:50-00:00 is double points"

**During Close Matches:**
- Monitor opponent score
- Communicate in alliance chat
- Coordinate who uses sprint when needed

### Sprint + Chinatsu + Research Stack:

The multipliers combine:

**50 golden wrenches at 23:55 with full bonuses:**
- Base: 250,000 points
- Sprint (2x): 500,000 points
- Event Expert (+100%): 1,000,000 points
- Event King (+200%): 1,500,000 points
- Chinatsu (+45%): 2,175,000 points
- Incentive - Vehicle (+100%): 2,900,000 points

**Same 50 wrenches: 250k base → 2.9M with sprint + bonuses = 11.6x multiplier!**

### Critical Notes:

**Don't Overcommit to Sprint:**
- You still need Full Preparedness points
- Don't save 100% for sprint - split 70/30 or 80/20
- Balance sprint gains with Full Prep chest rewards

**Sprint is Not Always Needed:**
- If alliance is dominating day easily, spread resources across Golden Hour
- If match is close or you want rank 1, sprint becomes critical
- Leadership calls sprint deployment based on opponent score

**Practice Sprint Timing:**
- First time users often fumble (wrong timing, slow execution)
- Practice on a save day to learn timing
- Have resources PRE-OPENED and ready to use instantly

## Conclusion

These advanced strategies transform Alliance Duel from a simple weekly event into a strategic competition where alliance coordination and long-term planning matter more than raw power or spending.

**The Four Pillars of Advanced Alliance Play:**

1. **Focus Days Strategy:** Alliance leadership coordinates which 3-4 days to dominate each week, while members save resources strategically and still earn chest rewards on save days
2. **Weekly Cycle Thinking:** The alliance operates in continuous cycles - always either competing or preparing for the next matchup
3. **Points Sprint Mastery:** Save best resources for final 10 minutes (23:50-00:00) to earn double points - can swing close matches and secure rank 1
4. **Chinatsu Investment:** Members who invest in Chinatsu gain 25-45% passive point bonuses that compound with research bonuses across all 6 days

**Implementation:** Alliance leadership should start with the Focus Days strategy first. Announce focus days at the beginning of each week and ensure all members understand which resources to deploy versus save. This single change can double alliance effectiveness by concentrating collective resources where they matter most.

The Chinatsu investment is an individual member decision that benefits the alliance - even base Chinatsu (25%) provides significant value without requiring full 5-star upgrades.

Alliance Duel rewards coordinated strategic thinking over individual power levels. Well-coordinated alliances with modest spending regularly defeat higher-power alliances that lack strategic planning.

**Next Steps:**
- Alliance leadership: Evaluate this week's opponent and announce focus days
- All members: Follow the alliance focus day strategy
- Individual members: Consider prioritizing Chinatsu in hero development
