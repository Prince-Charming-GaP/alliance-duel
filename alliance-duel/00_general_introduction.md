# Alliance Duel - General Introduction

---
Alliance duel is a 6-day competitive event where smart planning beats raw power. Let me break down what you need to know.

## What is Alliance Duel?

Alliance Duel is our weekly competitive event (Monday through Saturday) where we face another alliance in a points competition. **The winner isn't necessarily the strongest alliance—it's the alliance that plans best and works together.**

The key principle: **SAVE your resources all week and spend them ONLY on their designated theme day.** Whether you upgrade today or during the event doesn't matter for your progression, but during the event you get massive free rewards for the same actions! Full preparedness may form an exception to this, but that depends on our alliance duel margin. I will address this later.

## League System

Alliance Duel operates within a **league structure** with three competitive tiers:

- **Silver League** - Entry level for new alliances
- **Gold League** - Mid-tier competition with better rewards
- **Diamond League** - Top-tier competition with the best rewards

**How Leagues Work:**
- Each league competition consists of **multiple Alliance Duel weeks** (typically 4-6 weeks)
- Your alliance competes in a numbered group with other alliances at the same tier (e.g., "Silver League 1", "Silver League 2", etc.)
- **Promotion/Demotion** is determined by your win/loss record across all weeks in the competition
- Ranking within your league is based on: number of wins > when you lost (alliances that lose later rank higher)
- At the end of the competition, top performers are promoted to the next tier, bottom performers may be demoted
- Higher leagues offer significantly better rewards

**Key Point:** Every weekly duel matters! Your performance across the entire league season determines whether you move up, stay, or move down.

## Event Timing

- **Daily reset: 0:00 Server Time (0:00 GMT-2)**
- **Duration: 6 days** (Monday through Saturday)
- **Rest day: Sunday** - No Alliance Duel activities
- Each day has a different theme that determines what gives points

**Important:** Server Time = GMT-2 timezone. Convert to your local time!

## The Six Theme Days

1. **Day 1 (Mon):** Modded Vehicle Boost - Golden wrenches, vehicle upgrades, radar events
2. **Day 2 (Tuesday):** Shelter Upgrade - Building upgrades, construction speedups, bounties, recruitment
3. **Day 3 (Wednesday):** Age of Science - Research speedups, badges, intercity trade
4. **Day 4 (Thursday):** Hero Initiative - Hero fragments, exclusive equipment, power cores, Enhancement Alloy
5. **Day 5 (Friday):** Holistic Growth - Troop training, any speedups, power gains, radar events
6. **Day 6 (Saturday):** Enemy Buster - PvP combat

## Critical Rules

### 🚫 DON'T DO THIS:
- Don't spend resources on the wrong day (hero fragments on Day 2, construction speedups on Day 4, exclusive equipment fragments on Day 3, etc.)
- Don't complete green/blue/purple tasks when orange tasks are available
- Don't open resource chests until you need them (they scale to your HQ level!)
- Don't switch alliances mid-event (you'll lose all rewards!)
- Don't complete radar events immediately (stack them to 1 below your maximum capacity for theme days where they give points!)

### ✅ DO THIS:
- **Save EVERYTHING** for its correct theme day
- Only do **ORANGE tasks** when possible (they give 10-100x more points than lower tiers)
- Click "Help Alliance" button as much as possible to give free speedups to teammates
- Wait for "Golden Hour" (check Full Preparedness calendar for alignment timing)
- **CRITICAL: Save resources for Points Sprint (last 10 minutes before reset = 2x points!)**

## The Golden Hour Strategy

**What is Golden Hour?**

Golden Hour is when the Full Preparedness event theme aligns with your current Alliance Duel day theme. During this 4-hour window, your actions count for BOTH events simultaneously - meaning you get rewards from both Alliance Duel AND Full Preparedness for the same activities!

**How Full Preparedness Works:**
- Full Preparedness rotates through themes on a fixed daily schedule (Server Time):
    - **0:00-4:00** - Theme 1
    - **4:00-8:00** - Theme 2
    - **8:00-12:00** - Theme 3 (ALWAYS matches current Alliance Duel day!)
    - **12:00-16:00** - Theme 4
    - **16:00-20:00** - Theme 5
    - **20:00-24:00** - Theme 3 (ALWAYS matches current Alliance Duel day!)
- **KEY INSIGHT:** Theme 3 is dynamically set to match whatever the current Alliance Duel day theme is. This means you get **guaranteed Golden Hours** at 8:00-12:00 and 20:00-24:00 Server Time every single day!
- The other themes rotate through:
    - Hero Initiative
    - Shelter Upgrade
    - Army Expansion (corresponds to Holistic Growth in Alliance Duel)
    - Age of Science
    - Mod Vehicle Boost (corresponds to Modded Vehicle Boost in Alliance Duel)

**Guaranteed Golden Hours (Every Day!):**
- **8:00-12:00 Server Time** - Theme 3 window
- **20:00-24:00 Server Time** - Theme 3 window (repeats)

These two windows ALWAYS match your current Alliance Duel day theme, so you can reliably plan your major activities during these times to maximize rewards from both events!

**Additional Golden Hours:** You may also get bonus Golden Hours during the other time slots (0:00-4:00, 4:00-8:00, 12:00-16:00, 16:00-20:00) if those themes happen to align with your current Alliance Duel day. Check the Full Preparedness calendar in-game to see the rotation.

**Strategy:** Wait for Golden Hour windows to do your major upgrades, research, and resource spending - you'll unlock chests and earn medals for BOTH events with the same actions!

## The Points Sprint - DOUBLE POINTS!

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** The final 10 minutes before daily reset (00:00 Server Time) grants **2x points for ALL actions!**

**Points Sprint Window:**
- **23:50-00:00 Server Time** (10 minutes before reset)
- **ALL Alliance Duel actions earn DOUBLE points**
- No visible multiplier indicator in-game
- Most players don't know about this mechanic

**Ultimate Strategy - Golden Hour + Points Sprint:**

If you combine both mechanics during the 20:00-24:00 window:
- **20:00-23:50:** Use resources during Golden Hour (Alliance Duel + Full Preparedness rewards)
- **23:50-00:00:** Save your BEST resources for Points Sprint (2x Alliance Duel points!)

**Example with 50 Golden Wrenches (with research):**
- Normal time: 50 x 18,400 = 920,000 points
- Golden Hour: 920,000 points + Full Preparedness chests
- **Points Sprint: 50 x 36,800 = 1,840,000 points!**

**Critical Sprint Strategy:**
1. Save highest-value actions for final 10 minutes
2. Have resources ready (don't fumble during sprint!)
3. Use quick actions (golden wrenches, component boxes, badges)
4. Avoid slow actions (construction upgrades take time to start)
5. Watch the clock - don't miss the window!

**Why This Matters:**

Many alliances lose because opponents use Points Sprint while they don't. The 2x multiplier in final 10 minutes can swing victories. **If you're competing for rank 1 or close alliance duel match, Points Sprint is often the deciding factor.**

## Research Investment = Massive Multipliers

The **Alliance Recognition** research tree is the secret to high scores. Priority order:

1. **Event Expert** - +100% bonus points (doubles everything!)
2. **Premium Rewards** - Unlocks reward chests 4-6
3. **Super Rewards** - Unlocks reward chests 7-9
4. **Event King** - +200% bonus points (triples everything!)
5. **One More Research** - Unlocks additional reward chest
6. **Activity-specific Incentives** - Additional bonuses per day

With full research, you can turn 50 golden wrenches from 250,000 base points into 900,000+ points! This is why research investment matters more than military upgrades for event success.

**IMPORTANT: Research these on Day 3 (Age of Science) to get massive points from the badge consumption!**

## Reward Chests

You unlock 9 reward chest tiers through daily point accumulation:
- **Chests 1-3:** Everyone can access
- **Chests 4-6:** Requires "Premium Rewards" research
- **Chests 7-9:** Requires "Super Rewards" research
- **Extra chest:** Requires "One More Research" research

This is why researching Premium/Super/One More Rewards on Day 3 is so valuable - you get points from the research AND unlock better rewards!

## Minimum Alliance Participation

We need at least **20 active members** to participate. To help the alliance daily:
- Contribute to Alliance Tech research
- Click "Help Alliance" button (gives free speedups to members)
- Participate in VS events
- Be in position when alliance needs assistance

## Scoring Reality Check

**ORANGE TIER OR NOTHING.** Here are some examples:
- Orange bounty mission: 111,000 points
- Green bounty mission: **0 points**
- Orange hero fragment: 5,000 points
- Blue hero fragment: 500 points
- Orange intercity trade (S-rank): Points awarded
- Blue/purple/A-rank intercity trade: **0 points**

You can complete 100 green tasks and score less than 1 orange task. **Only refresh until you get orange!**

## Victory Strategy

With 13 points up for grabs each week, the alliance holding at least 7 points wins the alliance duel.

**Point Distribution:**
- Day 1 (Modded Vehicle): 1 point
- Day 2 (Shelter Upgrade): 2 points
- Day 3 (Age of Science): 2 points
- Day 4 (Hero Initiative): 2 points
- Day 5 (Holistic Growth): 2 points
- Day 6 (Enemy Buster): 4 points
- **Total: 13 points**

We win by:
1. **Everyone saving resources all week** for correct days
2. **Coordinating Golden Hour timing** for maximum rewards
3. **Focusing only on orange-tier activities**
4. **Investing in Alliance Recognition research**
5. **Working together and communicating**

This isn't about who spends the most - it's about who plans the best. Free-to-play players regularly hit top 10 rankings through smart strategy.
