# Alliance Duel - Day 5: Holistic Growth

**[‚Üê Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)** | **[‚Üê Day 4: Hero Initiative](04_day4_hero_initiative.md)**

Friday is **Day 5: Holistic Growth** - the FLEXIBLE DAY! This is when we train troops, use any leftover speedups, and boost overall power. It's also "cleanup day" for any remaining resources from earlier in the week!

## What Gives Points on Day 5

### üî• HIGH VALUE
1. **Troop Training** - 79 points per Level 1 troop trained (best ratio)
2. **Any Speedups** - 40 points per 1-minute speedup (construction, research, OR training)
3. **Power Gains** - 1 point per 10 power gained from ANY source
4. **Radar Events** - 5,000 points per completion

### Key Flexibility:
**Unlike other days, Day 5 accepts ANY type of speedup!**
- Construction speedups ‚úÖ
- Research speedups ‚úÖ
- Training speedups ‚úÖ
- All count for 40 points per minute!

## Week-Long Preparation Strategy

Day 5 success comes from saving speedups and planning troop capacity throughout the week:

### What to Do Before Day 5:

**Monday - Thursday (Days 1-4):**
- DO NOT train troops (save for Day 5)
- Save ALL training speedups
- Keep leftover construction/research speedups
- Don't fill military centers to 100% capacity
- Leave 10-20% room for event training
- Plan which troop level you'll train (Level 1 vs highest level)

**Why This Matters:**

If you train 1,000 troops on Wednesday:
- You train the troops (progression)
- You get 0 Alliance Duel points

If you wait and train those same troops on Day 5:
- You train the same troops
- You get 79,000+ Alliance Duel points
- **Same progression, massive bonus points!**

**The Golden Rule:** Any troop training should ONLY be done on Day 5 during Alliance Duel.

## The Troop Training Strategy

**Level 1 troops give the BEST speedup-to-point ratio!**

### The Math:
- Level 1 troop = ~79 points per troop
- Training 80 Level 1 troops = 6,320 points
- Uses minimal speedups and resources

**But there's a strategic choice:**

**Option A: Maximum Points (Level 1 troops)**
- Train ONLY Level 1 troops
- Best point efficiency
- Good if you don't plan to upgrade troops anyway

**Option B: Long-term Value (Highest level troops)**
- Train highest level troops you can
- Slightly worse point ratio
- Better if you plan to upgrade ALL troops to T10 eventually
- Same speedup cost, better long-term progression

**Recommendation:**
- If you're eventually upgrading all troops to T10 ‚Üí Train highest level
- If you're not upgrading troops soon ‚Üí Train Level 1 for max points
- Either way, **don't train before Day 5!**

## The "Any Speedup" Advantage

**Day 5 is cleanup day for leftover speedups!**

Did you miss using some speedups on their optimal days? Use them on Day 5!

### What Works on Day 5:
- Leftover construction speedups from Day 2 ‚úÖ
- Leftover research speedups from Day 3 ‚úÖ
- All training speedups ‚úÖ
- Any universal speedups ‚úÖ

**40 points per 1-minute speedup regardless of type!**

Plus you get 1 point per 10 power gained from whatever you're speeding up.

## The Power Gain Strategy

**Any power gain counts on Day 5!**

This means:
- Building upgrades ‚Üí Power + speedup points
- Research completion ‚Üí Power + speedup points
- Troop training ‚Üí Power + training points
- Hero leveling ‚Üí Power gains

**Strategy:** If you started expensive upgrades/research on Day 4, finish them with speedups on Day 5 Golden Hour for maximum benefit!

## Radar Events

**5,000 points per radar event completion!**

Just like Day 1, radar events give significant points on Day 5.

### Strategy:
- Complete ALL radar events on Day 5
- Cannot be held for later days
- Free 5,000 points each time
- Coordinate with alliance if needed

## Your Day 5 Action Plan

### BEFORE Day 5 Starts (Friday 0:00 Server Time):
- [ ] Count your training speedups
- [ ] Count any leftover construction/research speedups
- [ ] Check available radar events
- [ ] Decide: Level 1 troops (max points) or highest level (long-term value)?
- [ ] Check your military center capacity
- [ ] Ensure you didn't train troops on Thursday!

### STARTING Day 5 (Friday):
1. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (Around 8:00 Server Time or before reset)
2. **Start troop training** (Level 1 or highest level - your choice)
3. **Use ALL training speedups**
4. **Use any leftover speedups** from Days 2-4
5. **Complete ALL radar events** (5,000 points each)
6. **Finish any pending upgrades/research** from Day 4
7. **Focus on power-generating activities**

## Golden Hour Timing

**Day 5 Golden Hours:**
- **First window:** Around 8:00 Server Time (morning)
- **Second window:** Around 6:30pm Server Time (before reset)

**Everything counts during Golden Hour!**
- Alliance Duel points
- Full Preparedness rewards (if tasks align)
- Power progression
- Troop development

## Advanced Strategy: Free Up Training Capacity

**Problem:** Military centers at max capacity?

**Solutions:**

**Option 1 (Aggressive):**
- Let troops die in Territory vs Territory combat
- Or intentionally take HQ attacks
- Frees capacity for training during event
- Only viable if you have healing speedups saved

**Option 2 (Planned):**
- Train slightly under capacity all week
- Leaves room for event training
- Safer but requires planning ahead

**Option 3 (Accept it):**
- Train whatever capacity allows
- Use leftover speedups on research/construction
- Still score well from mixed activities

Most players should use Option 2 or 3. Option 1 is for advanced players only!

## What NOT to Do on Day 5

- ‚ùå **DON'T train troops before event starts** - Lose all points!
- ‚ùå **DON'T save training speedups for Day 6** - Day 5 is last chance!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches** - Day 1 only!
- ‚ùå **DON'T focus on bounties** - Day 2 only!
- ‚ùå **DON'T consume badges** - Day 3 only!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use hero fragments** - Day 4 only!

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 600,000 - 1,200,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 1,500,000 - 2,500,000 points
- **Top performers:** 3,000,000 - 4,500,000 points
- **MVP candidates:** 5,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** Speedup savings! Players with large speedup stockpiles can easily hit 2M+ points.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Training troops before event** - Losing tens of thousands of points
2. **Not using leftover speedups** - Missing the "cleanup day" opportunity
3. **Overthinking troop levels** - Either choice works, just pick one!
4. **Missing radar events** - Free 5,000 points each
5. **Not waiting for Golden Hour** - Missing double rewards

## The Training Efficiency Debate

**"Should I train Level 1 or highest level troops?"**

**Both strategies work! Here's the comparison:**

**Level 1 Training:**
- ‚úÖ Best point-per-speedup ratio (~79 points per troop)
- ‚úÖ Cheapest resource cost
- ‚úÖ Fastest training time
- ‚ùå No long-term value if upgrading troops later

**Highest Level Training:**
- ‚úÖ Long-term progression (will use these troops)
- ‚úÖ Higher power gains (more points from power)
- ‚úÖ Better if planning to upgrade all troops to T10
- ‚ùå Slightly worse point ratio

**Advice:** Think about your long-term plans. If you'll eventually upgrade all troops anyway, train highest level. If not, train Level 1 for maximum points.

**Either way, you'll score well - just pick one and commit!**

## Leftover Resources Strategy

**Day 5 is "cleanup day" for missed opportunities!**

Did you:
- Forget to use some construction speedups on Day 2?
- Have research speedups left after Day 3?
- Miss some hero upgrades on Day 4?

**Use them on Day 5!** While not optimal, 40 points per minute of speedup is better than zero points!

### Priority for Leftovers:
1. Training speedups (perfect for Day 5)
2. Research speedups (finish pending research)
3. Construction speedups (finish pending buildings)
4. Any universal speedups (use anywhere)

## Alliance Coordination

- Coordinate radar events if help needed
- Share in chat when starting major training queues
- Help teammates understand training strategy choices
- Encourage everyone to use leftover resources

## The Military Center Capacity Issue

**"My military centers are full, I can't train!"**

**Solutions in order of preference:**

**Best:** Plan ahead next week
- Don't fill military centers to 100% during the week
- Leave 10-20% capacity for event training
- Prevents this problem entirely

**Good:** Use leftover speedups elsewhere
- Focus on research speedups (finish techs)
- Use construction speedups (finish buildings)
- Still score well from power gains

**Risky:** Intentionally lose troops
- Only if you have healing speedups ready
- Only in Territory vs Territory (no gas cost)
- Advanced strategy - not recommended for most

**Remember:** Day 5 accepts ANY speedup type! Having full military centers reduces points but doesn't eliminate them.

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Things to use on Day 5:**
- ‚úÖ ALL training speedups
- ‚úÖ Any leftover construction speedups
- ‚úÖ Any leftover research speedups
- ‚úÖ Train troops (Level 1 or highest - your choice)
- ‚úÖ Complete ALL radar events (5,000 points each)
- ‚úÖ Finish pending upgrades from Day 4

**Things to save:**
- üíæ Combat resources and troops (Day 6 is tomorrow!)
- üíæ 24-hour shields (Day 6 if not fighting)

## Final Reminder

**Day 5 = Training Day = Cleanup Day = Flexible Day**

This is the most forgiving day:
1. **Any speedup type works** (40 points per minute)
2. **Any power gain counts** (1 point per 10 power)
3. **Training + radar + leftover resources** = solid score

The strategy is simple:
- Train troops during Golden Hour
- Use ALL remaining speedups (any type!)
- Complete all radar events
- Don't overthink it - just use everything you saved!

After Day 5, Day 6 is PvP combat. Build your troop strength on Day 5 to prepare!
