## Three Strategy Options

You have three viable approaches for Day 6. **All players should consider hunting** - it's the best way to learn combat mechanics and grow stronger!

### Strategy 1: AGGRESSIVE COMBAT (Strong Players)

**Best for:** High power players, coordinated alliances, those with resources to spare

**What to do:**
1. **Attack enemy territories** - Lower points but no gas cost, troops return
2. **Farm weaker HQs** - Higher points, costs gas, risk troop loss
3. **Coordinate with alliance** - Mass attacks on enemy cities
4. **Capture enemy cities** - Up to 21% ATK bonus (7% per city)
5. **Capture main city** - 10 million alliance points!

**Territory vs Territory (TvT) Combat:**
- ‚úÖ Troops return after combat (no permanent loss)
- ‚úÖ No gas cost
- ‚úÖ Earn points from defeating enemy units
- ‚ùå Lower point values than HQ attacks
- **Best for:** Safer combat with no long-term costs

**HQ Farming:**
- ‚úÖ Higher point values per kill
- ‚úÖ Can gain resources from farms
- ‚ùå Costs gas
- ‚ùå Risk permanent troop loss
- ‚ùå High healing costs
- **Best for:** Strong players targeting weak opponents

### Strategy 2: DEFENSIVE PARTICIPATION (Medium Players)

**Best for:** Mid-power players, those low on healing speedups, cautious players

**What to do:**
1. **Use 24-hour shield** - Protects your base
2. **Join HQ as reinforcement** - Still earn points while shielded!
3. **Selective combat** - Only fight when odds are favorable
4. **Help alliance defense** - Reinforce allied territories/cities

**The Reinforcement Strategy:**
This is the SECRET strategy most players don't know!

- You can be shielded AND earn points
- Join an alliance member's HQ as reinforcement
- When enemies attack that HQ, YOU get points
- Your base stays protected under shield
- **Free points with zero risk!**

**How it works:**
1. Activate 24-hour shield
2. Reinforce a strong alliance member's HQ
3. When enemies attack them, you earn combat points
4. Your own base never gets attacked
5. Profit!

### Strategy 3: LEARNING TO HUNT (Newer/Weaker Players)

**Best for:** Lower power players ready to learn combat mechanics and grow stronger

**THIS IS RECOMMENDED!** Even weak players benefit from learning to hunt:
- You become a better player by understanding combat
- Learn to scout, target selection, and resource management
- Practice makes you stronger for future weeks
- Looting resources accelerates your growth
- **The passive reinforcement strategy teaches you nothing!**

**What to do:**
1. **Start small** - Hunt farm accounts and very weak enemies
2. **Use 8-hour shields between hunts** - Protect your base when not actively playing
3. **Scout before attacking** - Learn to identify easy targets
4. **Loot resources strategically** - Understand the looting cap
5. **Learn from each battle** - Win or lose, you're building knowledge

**Shield Strategy for Hunters:**
- **8-hour shields** are better than 24-hour shields
- Shield when going offline or between hunting sessions
- Go online, hunt for 1-2 hours, shield again
- This protects you while learning to attack

**Why this is better than hiding:**
- ‚úÖ You learn combat mechanics
- ‚úÖ You gain looted resources (accelerates growth!)
- ‚úÖ You practice target selection
- ‚úÖ You become smarter and stronger
- ‚úÖ Even losses teach you valuable lessons
- ‚ùå Passive reinforcement strategy = learn nothing

**Note:** Only shield 24 hours and skip combat if your alliance faces an impossibly strong opponent (20M+ power difference). Otherwise, hunt and learn!

## Combat Mechanics

### Point System:
- **Tier 1 troops defeated:** 24 points per unit
- **Tier 10 troops defeated:** 136 points per unit
- **Against enemy alliance members:** 5x multiplier (5x points!)
- **Winner always scores more than loser**
- **Loser still scores something**

### Strategic Targets:

**High Value:**
- Enemy alliance members (5x point multiplier!)
- Weaker enemy HQs (easier kills, fewer losses)
- Enemy territories (safe combat, troops return)

**Medium Value:**
- Resource farms outside alliance (points but no multiplier)
- Neutral targets (if no better options)

**Low Value:**
- Your own alliance members (don't attack teammates!)
- Heavily shielded enemies (waste of attempts)
- Targets way above your power (certain defeat)

## Scouting and Looting Strategy

**Smart hunting combines scoring points with resource gathering!**

### How to Scout Enemy State:

**Step 1: Open Enemy Alliance Map**
- Tap on enemy alliance server
- View their city layout and member locations
- Identify potential targets

**Step 2: Scout Individual Targets**
- Tap on enemy HQ to view their power level
- Check if they're shielded (shield icon visible)
- Look for "farm" accounts (low power, high resources)
- Scout their troop composition if possible

**Step 3: Assess Target Viability**
- **Easy targets:** 30-50% of your power (safe wins)
- **Medium targets:** 50-80% of your power (possible wins)
- **Hard targets:** 80-100% of your power (risky)
- **Avoid:** Targets above your power (certain loss)

### Combining Points with Looting:

**The dual benefit:**
- Every attack on enemy alliance = 5x combat points
- PLUS you can loot resources from their base
- PLUS you gain combat experience

**Target priority for looting:**
1. **Farm accounts** - Low power, full resources, easy wins
2. **Inactive players** - Resources built up, often unshielded
3. **Weak active players** - Still learning, easier to beat
4. **Active strong players** - Higher risk, but higher rewards

### Understanding the Looting Cap:

**IMPORTANT: You can only loot a limited amount per attack!**

The looting cap depends on:
- Your HQ level
- Target's HQ level
- Your troop carrying capacity
- Resource type (food, metal, oil, etc.)

**Typical looting caps:**
- Low HQ levels (1-15): ~500K-1M per resource type
- Medium HQ levels (16-20): ~1M-3M per resource type
- High HQ levels (21-25): ~3M-10M per resource type

**Strategic implications:**
- **Don't overkill:** Sending too many troops wastes gas
- **Send appropriate force:** Just enough to win and carry max loot
- **Multiple smaller attacks** often more efficient than one massive attack
- **Focus on resource-rich targets** for maximum looting benefit

### The Learning Curve:

**For newer players, every attack teaches you:**
- How to evaluate target strength
- Which troop compositions work best
- How much gas to use efficiently
- When to attack vs when to skip
- Resource management under pressure

**Track your results:**
- Which targets you beat easily
- Which targets beat you
- How much loot you gained
- How much gas you spent
- Net profit/loss per attack

**After 10-20 attacks, you'll understand:**
- Your actual combat strength
- Which enemies you can beat
- How to maximize loot vs points
- When to retreat vs push forward

## City Capture Strategy (Advanced)

**For coordinated alliances only:**

**Benefits of capturing enemy cities:**
- 7% ATK bonus per city captured (up to 3 cities = 21% total!)
- Psychological impact on enemy
- 10 million alliance points for main city capture
- Shows dominance

**Requirements:**
- Coordinated alliance effort
- High power members
- Strategic timing
- Resources for sustained combat

**Most alliances:** Don't worry about city capture. Focus on territories and farming instead.

## Your Day 6 Action Plan

### BEFORE Day 6 Starts (Saturday 0:00 Server Time):
- [ ] Decide your strategy: Aggressive, Defensive, or Learning to Hunt
- [ ] Check your healing speedups (do you have enough?)
- [ ] Check your gas supply (needed for HQ attacks)
- [ ] Buy 8-hour shields for hunting (recommended for most players)
- [ ] Buy 24-hour shields only if staying fully defensive
- [ ] Coordinate with alliance in chat
- [ ] Position troops appropriately
- [ ] **Shield before going offline!**

### STARTING Day 6 (Saturday 0:00):

**If Aggressive Hunting:**
1. Scout enemy alliance members (find weaker targets)
2. Coordinate with alliance for territory attacks
3. Launch attacks during active hours
4. **Use 8-hour shields when going offline** (not 24-hour!)
5. Go online ‚Üí hunt for 1-2 hours ‚Üí shield when done
6. Keep healing speedups ready
7. Balance points with looting opportunities

**If Learning to Hunt (Newer Players):**
1. **Shield when offline, hunt when online**
2. Scout farm accounts and very weak enemies
3. Start with 3-5 attacks to learn mechanics
4. Track your wins/losses and loot gained
5. Use 8-hour shields between hunting sessions
6. Learn from every battle (win or lose!)
7. Focus on targets 30-50% of your power

**If Defensive (Reinforcement Only):**
1. Activate 24-hour shield
2. Join strong alliance member's HQ as reinforcement
3. Earn passive points when they get attacked
4. Stay protected while contributing
5. Use this only if truly unable to hunt

## What NOT to Do on Day 6

- ‚ùå **DON'T attack without checking power levels** - Easy way to lose troops
- ‚ùå **DON'T overcommit against superior opponents** - Accept some fights aren't winnable
- ‚ùå **DON'T attack your own alliance members** - Points only work against enemy alliance!
- ‚ùå **DON'T forget to shield** (if going defensive/full defense)
- ‚ùå **DON'T use resources saved for next week** - If matched badly, conserve for better weeks

## Competitive Targets

**Aggressive Hunters:**
- **Casual combat:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points
- **Strong combat:** 1,500,000 - 3,000,000 points
- **Top fighters:** 4,000,000+ points
- **MVP candidates:** 6,000,000+ points

**Learning Hunters (Newer Players):**
- **First-time hunters:** 50,000 - 200,000 points (great start!)
- **Improving hunters:** 200,000 - 500,000 points
- **Confident hunters:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points

**Defensive Players (Reinforcement Only):**
- **Reinforcement strategy:** 100,000 - 500,000 points
- **Limited combat:** 200,000 - 800,000 points

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Attacking without scouting** - Walking into stronger opponents
2. **Not having healing speedups ready** - Massive healing costs without speedups
3. **Attacking during low alliance activity** - No backup when needed
4. **Not using 8-hour shields between hunts** - Getting attacked while offline
5. **Forgetting to shield when going offline** - Losing resources unnecessarily
6. **Not learning to hunt** - Missing combat experience and growth opportunities
7. **Attacking randomly** - Target selection matters! Scout first
8. **Overcommitting in unwinnable weeks** - Sometimes strategic retreat is smart

## The Valor Medal Rewards

**Why Day 6 is unique:**

Normal days: Hero fragments in chests
Day 6: **Valor Medals** in chests

**Valor Medal value:**
- Trade for orange equipment in Merit Shop
- Premium equipment otherwise hard to acquire
- Makes Day 6 rewards worth fighting for

**Even if you score low, try to unlock some chests for the medals!**

## Alliance Coordination

**Critical for Day 6:**
- Communicate target selection in chat
- Call for reinforcements when needed
- Coordinate territory attack timing
- Share enemy scouting information
- Celebrate victories together
- Support each other through defeats

**Leadership roles (R4/R5):**
- Identify primary targets
- Coordinate mass attacks
- Call strategic retreats if needed
- Manage morale
- Make go/no-go decisions for risky fights

## The "Hopeless Week" Decision

**Sometimes matchmaking gives you an impossibly strong opponent.**

When this happens, smart alliances:
1. Recognize the power gap early
2. Coordinate resource conservation
3. Shield on Day 6
4. Save everything for next week
5. Accept this week as a strategic skip

**This is smart strategy, not giving up!**

Better to save resources for a winnable week than deplete everything in an unwinnable fight.

## Risk vs. Reward Analysis

**Aggressive Hunting:**
- ‚úÖ High point potential
- ‚úÖ Valor Medal rewards
- ‚úÖ Resource looting
- ‚úÖ Team coordination excitement
- ‚ùå Troop losses (manageable with healing speedups)
- ‚ùå Gas consumption
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use 8-hour shields between hunts

**Learning to Hunt (Recommended for Most):**
- ‚úÖ Learn combat mechanics
- ‚úÖ Gain combat experience
- ‚úÖ Loot resources to grow faster
- ‚úÖ Moderate points while learning
- ‚úÖ Build skills for future weeks
- ‚ùå Some troop losses (learning cost)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shield when offline (8-hour shields)

**Defensive Participation (Passive):**
- ‚úÖ Moderate points (via reinforcement)
- ‚úÖ Protected base (shielded)
- ‚úÖ Lower costs
- ‚ùå Learn nothing about combat
- ‚ùå Miss looting opportunities
- ‚ùå Moderate chest rewards

**Recommendation:** Even weak players should try hunting! The learning and looting benefits outweigh the costs.

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Hunting Approach (Recommended):**
- ‚úÖ **Shield when offline** (8-hour shields!)
- ‚úÖ Scout enemy power levels first

- ‚úÖ Target enemy alliance members (5x multiplier!)
- ‚úÖ Track looting vs gas spent
- ‚úÖ Keep healing speedups ready
- ‚úÖ Learn from every battle

**Aggressive Hunting:**
- ‚úÖ Scout enemy power levels first
- ‚úÖ Attack strategic targets
- ‚úÖ Coordinate with alliance
- ‚úÖ Use 8-hour shields between hunting sessions
- ‚úÖ Balance points with looting opportunities

**Defensive Approach (Only if truly unable to hunt):**

- ‚úÖ Reinforce alliance member's HQ
- ‚úÖ Earn passive points safely
- ‚ùå Miss learning combat mechanics

## Final Reminder

**Day 6 = Combat Day = Starts Saturday 0:00 Server Time!**

**This day is different from all others:**
1. Starts Saturday 0:00 (normal day start)
2. Rewards combat instead of resources
3. Gives Valor Medals instead of hero fragments
4. **Learning opportunity:** Even weak players should hunt!
5. **Shield management crucial:** Use 8-hour shields between hunts

**Choose YOUR strategy:**
- Strong and ready? Hunt aggressively with 8-hour shields!
- Newer/weaker? Start hunting to learn - target weak enemies!
- Truly unable? Use reinforcement strategy (but learn nothing)

**Recommendation:** Hunt and learn! Even small victories teach valuable combat skills and provide looted resources. Use 8-hour shields to stay safe between hunting sessions.

**Remember:** Shield when offline, hunt when online! This is the final day - finish strong and smarter!
