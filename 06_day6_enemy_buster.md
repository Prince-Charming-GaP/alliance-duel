## Three Strategy Options

Choose your approach based on your goals and playstyle, not just your power level. **We recommend hunting for growth**, but all strategies are valid!

### Strategy 1: ACTIVE HUNTING (Recommended for Growth)

**Best for:** Anyone wanting to learn combat, grow stronger, and loot resources - **all power levels can hunt!**

**Why hunt?**
- Learn combat mechanics and target selection
- Loot resources to accelerate your growth
- Practice makes you stronger for future weeks
- Gain combat experience that defensive play can't teach
- Even small victories build valuable skills

**CRITICAL: 8-Hour Shield Strategy for ALL Hunters**

Regardless of your power level, if you hunt you MUST use 8-hour shields:
- **Shield when going offline** - Protect your base when not playing
- **Shield between hunting sessions** - Go online ‚Üí hunt 1-2 hours ‚Üí shield when done
- This works for strong AND weak players
- Allows you to hunt safely without leaving your base exposed

**How to hunt by power level:**

**Strong players (high power):**
- TvT (Tank vs Tank) combat - no gas cost, safer practice
- Strategic HQ attacks - higher points, costs gas
- Coordinate mass attacks with alliance
- Target enemy alliance members (5x multiplier!)
- Use 8-hour shields when offline

**Medium players (mid power):**
- Focus on weaker enemies for safe wins
- Farm accounts for easy loot and points
- TvT combat for gas-free practice
- Avoid targets above your power
- Use 8-hour shields when offline

**Weaker players (lower power):**
- Start with farm accounts (easy wins)
- Target inactive players (resources built up)
- Learn to scout and evaluate targets
- Avoid active strong players completely
- Use 8-hour shields religiously

**Combat Options:**

**TvT (Tank vs Tank) Combat:**
- ‚úÖ Player vs player combat
- ‚úÖ No gas cost
- ‚úÖ Troops return if opponent doesn't have annihilation
- ‚úÖ Earn points from defeating enemy units
- ‚ùå Lower point values than HQ attacks
- **Best for:** All power levels - safer combat practice

**HQ Farming:**
- ‚úÖ Higher point values per kill
- ‚úÖ Loot resources from enemy bases
- ‚ùå Costs gas
- ‚ùå Risk permanent troop loss (if they have annihilation)
- ‚ùå Healing costs
- **Best for:** Targeting much weaker opponents

**Key takeaway:** Hunt at YOUR level, use 8-hour shields, learn and grow!

### Strategy 2: SHIELD WITH REINFORCEMENT (Passive Points)

**Best for:** Players who cannot or prefer not to hunt actively

**What to do:**
1. **Activate 24-hour shield** - Full protection all day
2. **Join alliance member's HQ as reinforcement** - Earn passive points
3. **Stay shielded entire day** - Zero risk approach

**The Reinforcement Strategy:**
- You can be shielded AND earn points
- Join a strong alliance member's HQ as reinforcement
- When enemies attack that HQ, YOU get points
- Your base stays protected under shield
- Moderate points with zero risk

**How it works:**
1. Activate 24-hour shield
2. Reinforce a strong alliance member's HQ
3. When enemies attack them, you earn combat points
4. Your own base never gets attacked
5. Collect passive points safely

**When to use this strategy:**
- You don't want to learn combat mechanics
- You prefer passive playstyle
- You're saving resources for next week
- You have limited time to play actively
- You simply prefer a safe, low-effort approach

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Zero risk, zero losses, zero costs
- ‚úÖ Moderate points via reinforcement
- ‚úÖ Protected all day
- ‚ùå Learn nothing about combat
- ‚ùå Miss looting opportunities
- ‚ùå Don't improve combat skills for future weeks

**This is a valid choice!** Not everyone wants to learn combat, and that's okay.

### Strategy 3: FULL SHIELD (Pure Defense)

**Best for:** Strategic resource conservation in unwinnable weeks

**What to do:**
1. **Activate 24-hour shield** - Complete protection
2. **Stay shielded all day** - Don't participate
3. **Save all resources for next week**

**When to use this:**
- Your alliance faces an impossibly strong opponent (20M+ power difference)
- Strategic decision to conserve for a winnable week
- The matchup is completely hopeless
- Better to save everything for next Alliance Duel

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Zero losses, maximum resource conservation
- ‚úÖ Save gas, healing speedups, troops for next week
- ‚ùå Minimal/zero chest rewards
- ‚ùå No points, no learning, no loot
- ‚ùå Miss all Day 6 Valor Medals

**This is strategic, not cowardice!** Sometimes the smartest move is to skip an unwinnable fight.

## Combat Mechanics

### Point System:
- **Tier 1 troops defeated:** 24 points per unit
- **Tier 10 troops defeated:** 136 points per unit
- **Against enemy alliance members:** 5x multiplier (5x points!)
- **Winner always scores more than loser**
- **Loser still scores something**

### Strategic Targets:

**High Value:**
- Enemy alliance members (5x point multiplier!)
- Weaker enemy HQs (easier kills, good loot)
- TvT targets without annihilation (safe combat, troops return)

**Medium Value:**
- Resource farms outside alliance (points but no multiplier)
- Neutral targets (if no better options)

**Low Value:**
- Your own alliance members (don't attack teammates!)
- Heavily shielded enemies (waste of attempts)
- Targets way above your power (certain defeat)

## Scouting and Looting Strategy

**Smart hunting combines scoring points with resource gathering!**

### How to Scout Enemy State:

**Step 1: Open Enemy Alliance Map**
- Tap on enemy alliance server
- View their city layout and member locations
- Identify potential targets

**Step 2: Scout Individual Targets**
- Tap on enemy HQ to view their power level
- Check if they're shielded (shield icon visible)
- Look for "farm" accounts (low power, high resources)
- Scout their troop composition if possible

**Step 3: Assess Target Viability**
- **Easy targets:** 30-50% of your power (safe wins)
- **Medium targets:** 50-80% of your power (possible wins)
- **Hard targets:** 80-100% of your power (risky)
- **Avoid:** Targets above your power (certain loss)

### Combining Points with Looting:

**The dual benefit:**
- Every attack on enemy alliance = 5x combat points
- PLUS you can loot resources from their base
- PLUS you gain combat experience

**Target priority for looting:**
1. **Farm accounts** - Low power, full resources, easy wins
2. **Inactive players** - Resources built up, often unshielded
3. **Weak active players** - Still learning, easier to beat
4. **Active strong players** - Higher risk, but higher rewards

### Understanding the Looting Cap:

**IMPORTANT: You can only loot a limited amount per attack!**

The looting cap depends on:
- Your HQ level
- Target's HQ level
- Your troop carrying capacity
- Resource type (food, metal, oil, etc.)

**Typical looting caps:**
- Low HQ levels (1-15): ~500K-1M per resource type
- Medium HQ levels (16-20): ~1M-3M per resource type
- High HQ levels (21-25): ~3M-10M per resource type

**Strategic implications:**
- **Don't overkill:** Sending too many troops wastes gas
- **Send appropriate force:** Just enough to win and carry max loot
- **Multiple smaller attacks** often more efficient than one massive attack
- **Focus on resource-rich targets** for maximum looting benefit

### The Learning Curve:

**For newer players, every attack teaches you:**
- How to evaluate target strength
- Which troop compositions work best
- How much gas to use efficiently
- When to attack vs when to skip
- Resource management under pressure

**Track your results:**
- Which targets you beat easily
- Which targets beat you
- How much loot you gained
- How much gas you spent
- Net profit/loss per attack

**After 10-20 attacks, you'll understand:**
- Your actual combat strength
- Which enemies you can beat
- How to maximize loot vs points
- When to retreat vs push forward

## Teleportation Strategy and Safety

**CRITICAL: Master teleportation to hunt safely!**

### The Enemy Buster Menu Teleport:

**You can ALWAYS teleport back to your own state via the Enemy Buster menu!**

This is your emergency escape button:
- Open Enemy Buster menu (event interface)
- Tap "Return to Own State" button
- Instant teleport back to safety
- Use this whenever you feel threatened

### The 30-Second Rule (VERY IMPORTANT):

**NEVER send your tanks further than 30 seconds from your HQ!**

**Why this matters:**
- If danger appears, you need time to recall troops
- Troops far from HQ = vulnerable to attacks
- Can't teleport with troops marching
- 30 seconds = safe recall distance

**Best practice:**
1. Attack targets near where you teleported
2. If targets are far away, **teleport again closer to them**
3. Don't be lazy - teleport multiple times!
4. Keep troops within 30-second recall range

**If you ignore this rule:**
- At minimum, leave your **strongest tank in your HQ**
- This tank defends your base if attacked
- Better than having all tanks out marching
- But still risky - follow the 30-second rule!

### War Frenzy: The 10-Minute Shield Lockout

**DANGER: War Frenzy = 10 minutes without shield protection!**

**What is War Frenzy:**
- Triggered when you attack or get attacked
- Lasts 10 minutes
- You CANNOT activate shields during this time
- You can HAVE a shield, but can't activate a NEW one
- Your HQ is vulnerable during these 10 minutes

**Strategy during War Frenzy:**
1. **If safe:** Continue hunting, you have 10 minutes
2. **If threatened:** Teleport to enemy state to escape
3. **Wait out the 10 minutes** before returning
4. **Then shield immediately** when back in your state

### Emergency Escape Procedure:

**High-level enemy in your hive after you teleport back?**

1. **Don't panic** - You have options
2. **Teleport to enemy state immediately** (via Enemy Buster menu)
3. **Wait 30 seconds** - Cooldown after returning to own state
4. **Stay in enemy state** until threat passes
5. **Return when safe** and shield immediately

**Important timing:**
- 30-second cooldown after teleporting to your own state
- Can't immediately teleport back to enemy state
- Plan your return timing carefully
- Check for threats before returning

### Getting Hit Isn't a Disaster:

**Don't be paralyzed by fear of getting attacked!**

**If your HQ gets hit once or twice:**
- ‚úÖ You still score points (loser still gets points!)
- ‚úÖ You get healing speedups to recover
- ‚úÖ This is part of the learning process
- ‚úÖ Temporary setback, not a catastrophe

**The real danger:**
- ‚ùå Multiple repeated attacks (losing all resources)
- ‚ùå Not shielding when offline (easy target)
- ‚ùå Staying visible with full resources (attractive target)

**Takeaway:** One or two hits = manageable. Many repeated hits = time to shield!

## Your Day 6 Action Plan

### BEFORE Day 6 Starts (Saturday 0:00 Server Time):
- [ ] Decide your strategy: Active Hunting, Shield with Reinforcement, or Full Shield
- [ ] **Buy 8-hour shields if hunting** (for ALL power levels!)
- [ ] Buy 24-hour shields only if using Strategy 2 or 3
- [ ] Check your healing speedups (do you have enough if hunting?)
- [ ] Check your gas supply (needed for HQ attacks)
- [ ] **Spend free resources on construction** (resources NOT in warehouse!)
- [ ] Empty your base of loose resources to become less attractive target
- [ ] Coordinate with alliance in chat
- [ ] Position troops appropriately
- [ ] **Plan to shield when offline - critical for all hunters!**

**IMPORTANT: Resource Management Before Day 6**

Your warehouse protects resources, but **free resources** (not in warehouse) are vulnerable to looting!

**Before Day 6:**
1. Check how many resources are outside your warehouse
2. Spend these free resources on building upgrades if possible
3. Start expensive construction projects to use up loose resources
4. This makes you a less attractive target for enemy looters
5. Resources in your warehouse are protected - only free resources get looted

**Strategy:** The fewer free resources you have, the less valuable you are as a target!

### STARTING Day 6 (Saturday 0:00):

**If Active Hunting (Strategy 1 - All Power Levels):**
1. **Activate 8-hour shield first** - protect your base
2. Scout enemy alliance members (find appropriate targets for your power)
3. Go online, hunt for 1-2 hours
4. **Shield again when done or going offline**
5. Strong players: Use TvT or HQ attacks
6. Medium/weak players: Target farm accounts and weaker enemies
7. Keep healing speedups ready
8. Balance points with looting opportunities
9. Repeat cycle: Online ‚Üí Hunt ‚Üí Shield

**If Shield with Reinforcement (Strategy 2 - Passive):**
1. Activate 24-hour shield immediately
2. Join strong alliance member's HQ as reinforcement
3. Earn passive points when they get attacked
4. Stay protected while contributing
5. No need to be actively online

**If Full Shield (Strategy 3 - Conservation):**
1. Activate 24-hour shield immediately
2. Stay shielded all day
3. Don't participate in any combat
4. Save all resources for next week
5. Accept minimal/zero rewards

## What NOT to Do on Day 6

- ‚ùå **DON'T attack without checking power levels** - Easy way to lose troops
- ‚ùå **DON'T overcommit against superior opponents** - Accept some fights aren't winnable
- ‚ùå **DON'T attack your own alliance members** - Points only work against enemy alliance!
- ‚ùå **DON'T forget to shield** (if going defensive/full defense)
- ‚ùå **DON'T use resources saved for next week** - If matched badly, conserve for better weeks

## Competitive Targets

**Active Hunting (Strategy 1):**

*Experienced Hunters:*
- **Casual combat:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points
- **Strong combat:** 1,500,000 - 3,000,000 points
- **Top fighters:** 4,000,000+ points
- **MVP candidates:** 6,000,000+ points

*Learning Hunters (All Power Levels):*
- **First-time hunters:** 50,000 - 200,000 points (great start!)
- **Improving hunters:** 200,000 - 500,000 points
- **Confident hunters:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points

**Shield with Reinforcement (Strategy 2):**
- **Reinforcement strategy:** 100,000 - 500,000 points
- **Limited participation:** 200,000 - 800,000 points

**Full Shield (Strategy 3):**
- **No participation:** 0 - 50,000 points (minimal/zero rewards)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Attacking without scouting** - Walking into stronger opponents
2. **Not having healing speedups ready** - Massive healing costs without speedups
3. **Attacking during low alliance activity** - No backup when needed
4. **Not using 8-hour shields between hunts** - Getting attacked while offline
5. **Forgetting to shield when going offline** - Losing resources unnecessarily
6. **Not learning to hunt** - Missing combat experience and growth opportunities
7. **Attacking randomly** - Target selection matters! Scout first
8. **Overcommitting in unwinnable weeks** - Sometimes strategic retreat is smart
9. **Sending troops more than 30 seconds from HQ** - Can't recall in time if threatened
10. **Not spending free resources before Day 6** - Becoming attractive looting target
11. **Forgetting about War Frenzy** - Can't shield for 10 minutes after combat
12. **Panicking when hit once** - One attack isn't a disaster, shield after multiple hits

## The Valor Medal Rewards

**Why Day 6 is unique:**

Normal days: Hero fragments in chests
Day 6: **Valor Medals** in chests

**Valor Medal value:**
- Trade for orange equipment in Merit Shop
- Premium equipment otherwise hard to acquire
- Makes Day 6 rewards worth fighting for

**Even if you score low, try to unlock some chests for the medals!**

## Alliance Coordination

**Critical for Day 6:**
- Communicate target selection in chat
- Call for reinforcements when needed
- Coordinate territory attack timing
- Share enemy scouting information
- Celebrate victories together
- Support each other through defeats

**Leadership roles (R4/R5):**
- Identify primary targets
- Coordinate mass attacks
- Call strategic retreats if needed
- Manage morale
- Make go/no-go decisions for risky fights

## The "Hopeless Week" Decision

**Sometimes matchmaking gives you an impossibly strong opponent.**

When this happens, smart alliances:
1. Recognize the power gap early
2. Coordinate resource conservation
3. Shield on Day 6
4. Save everything for next week
5. Accept this week as a strategic skip

**This is smart strategy, not giving up!**

Better to save resources for a winnable week than deplete everything in an unwinnable fight.
