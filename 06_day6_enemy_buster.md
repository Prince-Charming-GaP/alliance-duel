**[‚Üê Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)** | **[‚Üê Day 5: Holistic Growth](05_day5_holistic_growth.md)**

---

Saturday is **Day 6: Enemy Buster** - the PvP combat finale of Alliance Duel! This day starts at **0:00 Server Time on Saturday**, running through the end of the event. Unlike previous resource management days, this day rewards direct combat and smart looting strategy! This day is pure fun!

## What Gives Points on Day 6

### üî• COMBAT POINTS
1. **Defeating ANY Enemy Units** - 24-136 points per unit (Tier 1-10)
2. **Fighting Enemy Alliance Members** - **5x points** (5x multiplier when fighting opponent alliance!)
3. **Fighting Other Players** - **Base points** (1x - any player in enemy state gives points)
4. **Winner Bonus** - Winner always scores more than loser
5. **Loser Still Scores** - Even losing gives points (just fewer)

**Important: You don't need to ONLY attack the enemy alliance to score!**
- Enemy alliance members = 5x points (best value)
- Any other player in enemy state = 1x points (still counts!)
- Even in "unwinnable weeks" you can hunt other players for points

### üéÅ UNIQUE REWARDS
**Day 6 chests contain Valor Medals instead of hero fragments!**
- Up to 5,200 Valor Medals available (10,400 with Premium/Super Rewards unlocked)
- Trade medals for orange equipment in Merit Shop
- Makes Day 6 rewards uniquely valuable

## Three Strategy Options

Choose your approach based on your goals and playstyle, not just your power level. **We recommend hunting for growth**, but all strategies are valid!

### Strategy 1: ACTIVE HUNTING (Recommended for Growth)

**Best for:** Anyone wanting to learn combat, grow stronger, and loot resources - **all power levels can hunt!**

**Why hunt?**
- Learn combat mechanics and target selection
- Loot resources to accelerate your growth
- Practice makes you stronger for future weeks
- Gain combat experience that defensive play can't teach
- Even small victories build valuable skills

**CRITICAL: 8-Hour Shield Strategy for ALL Hunters**

Regardless of your power level, if you hunt you MUST use 8-hour shields:
- **Shield when going offline** - Protect your base when not playing
- **Shield between hunting sessions** - Go online ‚Üí hunt 1-2 hours ‚Üí shield when done
- This works for strong AND weak players
- Allows you to hunt safely without leaving your base exposed

**How to hunt by power level:**

**Strong players (high power):**
- TvT (Tank vs Tank) combat - no gas cost, safer practice
- Strategic HQ attacks - higher points, costs gas
- Coordinate mass attacks with alliance
- Target enemy alliance members (5x multiplier!)
- Use 8-hour shields when offline

**Medium players (mid power):**
- Focus on weaker enemies for safe wins
- Farm accounts for easy loot and points
- TvT combat for gas-free practice
- Avoid targets above your power
- Use 8-hour shields when offline

**Weaker players (lower power):**
- Start with farm accounts (easy wins)
- Target inactive players (resources built up)
- Learn to scout and evaluate targets
- Avoid active strong players completely
- Use 8-hour shields religiously

**Combat Options:**

**TvT (Tank vs Tank) Combat:**
- ‚úÖ Player vs player combat
- ‚úÖ No gas cost
- ‚úÖ Troops return if opponent doesn't have annihilation
- ‚úÖ Earn points from defeating enemy units
- ‚ùå Lower point values than HQ attacks
- **Best for:** All power levels - safer combat practice

**HQ Farming:**
- ‚úÖ Higher point values per kill
- ‚úÖ Loot resources from enemy bases
- ‚ùå Costs gas
- ‚ùå Risk permanent troop loss (if they have annihilation)
- ‚ùå Healing costs
- **Best for:** Targeting much weaker opponents

**Key takeaway:** Hunt at YOUR level, use 8-hour shields, learn and grow!

### Strategy 2: SHIELD WITH REINFORCEMENT (Passive Points)

**Best for:** Players who cannot or prefer not to hunt actively

**What to do:**
1. **Activate 24-hour shield** - Full protection all day
2. **Join alliance member's HQ as reinforcement** - Earn passive points
3. **Stay shielded entire day** - Zero risk approach

**The Reinforcement Strategy:**
- You can be shielded AND earn points
- Join a strong alliance member's HQ as reinforcement
- When enemies attack that HQ, YOU get points
- Your base stays protected under shield
- Moderate points with zero risk

**How it works:**
1. Activate 24-hour shield
2. Reinforce a strong alliance member's HQ
3. When enemies attack them, you earn combat points
4. Your own base never gets attacked
5. Collect passive points safely

**When to use this strategy:**
- You don't want to learn combat mechanics
- You prefer passive playstyle
- You're saving resources for next week
- You have limited time to play actively
- You simply prefer a safe, low-effort approach

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Zero risk, zero losses, zero costs
- ‚úÖ Moderate points via reinforcement
- ‚úÖ Protected all day
- ‚ùå Learn nothing about combat
- ‚ùå Miss looting opportunities
- ‚ùå Don't improve combat skills for future weeks

**This is a valid choice!** Not everyone wants to learn combat, and that's okay.

### Strategy 3: FULL SHIELD (Pure Defense)

**Best for:** Strategic resource conservation in unwinnable weeks

**What to do:**
1. **Activate 24-hour shield** - Complete protection
2. **Stay shielded all day** - Don't participate
3. **Save all resources for next week**

**When to use this:**
- Your alliance faces an impossibly strong opponent (20M+ power difference)
- Strategic decision to conserve for a winnable week
- The matchup is completely hopeless
- Better to save everything for next Alliance Duel

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Zero losses, maximum resource conservation
- ‚úÖ Save gas, healing speedups, troops for next week
- ‚ùå Minimal/zero chest rewards
- ‚ùå No points, no learning, no loot
- ‚ùå Miss all Day 6 Valor Medals

**This is strategic, not cowardice!** Sometimes the smartest move is to skip an unwinnable fight.

## Combat Mechanics

### Point System:
- **Tier 1 troops defeated:** 24 points per unit
- **Tier 10 troops defeated:** 136 points per unit
- **Against enemy alliance members:** 5x multiplier (5x points!)
- **Winner always scores more than loser**
- **Loser still scores something**

### Strategic Targets:

**High Value:**
- Enemy alliance members (5x point multiplier!)
- Weaker enemy HQs (easier kills, good loot)
- TvT targets without annihilation (safe combat, troops return)

**Medium Value:**
- Resource farms outside alliance (points but no multiplier)
- Neutral targets (if no better options)

**Low Value:**
- Your own alliance members (don't attack teammates!)
- Heavily shielded enemies (waste of attempts)
- Targets way above your power (certain defeat)

## Scouting and Looting Strategy

**Smart hunting combines scoring points with resource gathering!**

### Pre-Teleport Reconnaissance:

**BEFORE you teleport to enemy state, scout from your own state:**

1. **Open the map view** (before teleporting)
2. **Limited zoom available** - You can view enemy state but with restrictions
3. **Identify high-potential areas** - Look for clusters of bases
4. **You CANNOT scout individual targets yet** - Full scouting only works after teleport
5. **Plan your teleport location** - Choose areas with target density

**Why this matters:**
- Saves time once you teleport
- Identify promising hunting grounds
- Avoid empty areas of the map
- Plan your route before committing to teleport

### Advanced Hunting: Burning HQs and Vulnerable Targets

**üî• BURNING HQs = HIGH PRIORITY TARGETS!**

When scouting the map pre-teleport, **look for burning HQs** (bases currently under attack).

**Why burning HQs are valuable:**
- Someone else found them interesting = probably good loot
- Target might be distracted fighting off current attack
- Often have resources worth taking

**Watch for this:** Check what the attacker is doing with their HQs!

### GOLD MINE: Enemy With 3 Tanks Out on March

**The absolute BEST hunting opportunity:**

**When you see an enemy player attacking with 3 tanks (their entire army marching):**

1. **Their HQ is VULNERABLE!** - No tanks home to defend
2. **Check tank distance** - Are tanks far from their HQ? (remember our 30-second rule!)
3. **If tanks are far away:** That player broke the 30-second rule and is exposed!

**The attack sequence:**

**If you want their resources:**
1. **Teleport directly next to their HQ** (right beside it!)
2. **Attack IMMEDIATELY** while their tanks are far away
3. **Loot everything quickly** before they can recall
4. **Recall your troops and shield** as soon as loot is secured

**If you fear their 3 returning tanks (worried they'll counterattack):**
1. **Destroy their HQ completely** (not just loot, but annihilate)
2. **This forces their HQ to relocate to outer ring**
3. **They lose track of where you are**
4. **You run minimal risk of counterattack**

**Why this works:**
- They violated the 30-second rule (troops too far)
- Can't recall troops in time to defend
- By the time tanks return, you're done or they're relocated
- This is the punishment for sending tanks too far!

**This is why WE follow the 30-second rule** - so this doesn't happen to us!

### Destroyed HQ Relocation:

**Important map mechanic to understand:**

When an HQ is destroyed, it automatically relocates to the **outer ring of the map**.

**Strategic implications:**
- ‚úÖ Outer ring often has HIGH DENSITY of bases (many destroyed HQs)
- ‚ùå Most are already looted (picked clean by others)
- ‚ùå Hard to find targets with good loot potential
- ‚úÖ Good for points if you just want combat
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inner areas often have better untouched targets

**Strategy:** Scout inner map areas first for fresh targets with resources!

### How to Scout Enemy State (After Teleporting):

**Step 1: Teleport to Enemy State**
- Use Enemy Buster menu to enter enemy state
- Choose landing location based on pre-teleport reconnaissance
- Recall all troops to HQ before teleporting

**Step 2: Scout Individual Targets**
- Tap on enemy HQ to view their power level
- Check if they're shielded (shield icon visible)
- Look for "farm" accounts (low power, high resources)
- Send scout to check troop composition and exact resources

**Step 3: Assess Target Viability**
- **Easy targets:** 30-50% of your power (safe wins)
- **Medium targets:** 50-80% of your power (possible wins)
- **Hard targets:** 80-100% of your power (risky)
- **Avoid:** Targets above your power (certain loss)

### Combining Points with Looting:

**The dual benefit:**
- Every attack on enemy alliance = 5x combat points
- PLUS you can loot resources from their base
- PLUS you gain combat experience

**Target priority for looting:**
1. **Farm accounts** - Low power, full resources, easy wins
2. **Inactive players** - Resources built up, often unshielded
3. **Weak active players** - Still learning, easier to beat
4. **Active strong players** - Higher risk, but higher rewards

### Understanding the Looting Cap:

**IMPORTANT: You can only loot a limited amount per attack!**

The looting cap depends on:
- Your HQ level (higher HQ = much higher cap)
- Target's HQ level
- Your troop carrying capacity
- Technologies researched (Military techs increase capacity)
- Resource type (food, metal, oil, etc.)

**Looting caps scale significantly with HQ level:**
- HQ level 26 can loot ~100M per resource type
- Earlier HQ levels have proportionally lower caps
- The difference between HQ levels is substantial
- Check your march info in-game to see your actual carrying capacity

**Strategic implications:**
- **Don't overkill:** Sending too many troops wastes gas
- **Send appropriate force:** Just enough to win and carry max loot
- **Multiple smaller attacks** often more efficient than one massive attack
- **Focus on resource-rich targets** for maximum looting benefit
- **Higher HQ = MUCH higher loot potential** - Upgrading HQ dramatically increases carrying capacity
- **Research military techs** - Many increase troop carrying capacity

### Optimal Hunting Timing:

**BEST TIME TO HUNT: Immediately after Day 6 reset (Saturday 0:00 Server Time)!**

**Why the first hours are golden:**

1. **Maximum loot availability:**
   - Most bases still have full resources
   - Not yet looted by other hunters
   - Fresh targets everywhere

2. **Forgotten shields:**
   - Many players forget to activate shields
   - Some fall asleep before reset
   - Easy undefended targets available

3. **Target abundance:**
   - High density of vulnerable bases
   - Better selection of farm accounts
   - More inactive players unshielded

**Strategy:**
- Set alarm for reset time if possible
- First 2-4 hours are peak hunting time
- Later in the day = picked-over targets
- Most profitable looting happens early

**But don't worry if you miss reset:**
- You can still hunt successfully any time during Day 6
- Just understand early hunters get fresher targets
- Focus on outer ring avoidance and inner map scouting

### The Learning Curve:

**For newer players, every attack teaches you:**
- How to evaluate target strength
- Which troop compositions work best
- How much gas to use efficiently
- When to attack vs when to skip
- Resource management under pressure

**Track your results:**
- Which targets you beat easily
- Which targets beat you
- How much loot you gained
- How much gas you spent
- Net profit/loss per attack

**After 10-20 attacks, you'll understand:**
- Your actual combat strength
- Which enemies you can beat
- How to maximize loot vs points
- When to retreat vs push forward

## Teleportation Strategy and Safety

**CRITICAL: Master teleportation to hunt safely!**

### The Enemy Buster Menu Teleport:

**You can ALWAYS teleport back to your own state via the Enemy Buster menu!**

This is your emergency escape button:
- Open Enemy Buster menu (event interface)
- Tap "Return to Own State" button
- Instant teleport back to safety
- Use this whenever you feel threatened

**IMPORTANT: Teleportation Restrictions**

You CANNOT teleport if:
- ‚ùå You have a scout action in progress (scouting an enemy base)
- ‚ùå Your tanks are not in your HQ (troops are marching or stationed elsewhere)

**Before teleporting:**
- Recall all troops back to your HQ
- Wait for scouts to complete
- Only then can you teleport safely

### The 30-Second Rule (VERY IMPORTANT):

**NEVER send your tanks further than 30 seconds from your HQ!**

**Why this matters:**
- If danger appears, you need time to recall troops
- Troops far from HQ = vulnerable to attacks
- Can't teleport with troops marching
- 30 seconds = safe recall distance

**Best practice:**
1. Attack targets near where you teleported
2. If targets are far away, **teleport again closer to them**
3. Don't be lazy - teleport multiple times!
4. Keep troops within 30-second recall range

**If you ignore this rule:**
- At minimum, leave your **strongest tank in your HQ**
- This tank defends your base if attacked
- Better than having all tanks out marching
- But still risky - follow the 30-second rule!

### War Frenzy: The 10-Minute Shield Lockout

**DANGER: War Frenzy = 10 minutes without shield protection!**

**What is War Frenzy:**
- Triggered when you attack or get attacked
- Lasts 10 minutes
- You CANNOT activate shields during this time
- You can HAVE a shield, but can't activate a NEW one
- Your HQ is vulnerable during these 10 minutes

**Strategy during War Frenzy:**
1. **If safe:** Continue hunting when you are still up to it
2. **If threatened:** Teleport to enemy state to escape
3. **Wait out the 10 minutes** after you last hq attack to return
4. **Then shield immediately** when back in your state

### Emergency Escape Procedure:

**Higher-level enemy in your hive after you teleport back?**

1. **Don't panic** - You have options
2.  **Pray your HQ is not close to the enemy and wait for 30 seconds** - Cooldown after returning to own state
3.  **Teleport to safe spot in enemy state asap** (via Enemy Buster menu)
4. **Stay in enemy state** until threat passes
5. **Return when safe** and shield immediately



**Important timing:**
- 30-second cooldown after teleporting to your own state
- Can't immediately teleport back to enemy state
- Don't panic when you are attacked, they usually don't break your defence within the cooldown period
- Plan your return timing carefully
- Check for threats before returning

### Getting Hit Isn't a Disaster:

**Don't be paralyzed by fear of getting attacked!**

**If your HQ gets hit once or twice:**
- ‚úÖ You still score points (loser still gets points!)
- ‚úÖ You get healing speedups to recover
- ‚úÖ This is part of the learning process
- ‚úÖ Temporary setback, not a catastrophe

**The real danger:**
- ‚ùå Multiple repeated attacks (losing all resources)
- ‚ùå Not shielding when offline (easy target)
- ‚ùå Staying visible with full resources (attractive target)

**Takeaway:** One or two hits = manageable. Many repeated hits = time to shield!

### FREE Teleport Back to Hive (If Your HQ Was Destroyed):

**üí° IMPORTANT TIP: If your HQ was destroyed during Day 6, you get a FREE teleport back to your hive!**

**How it works:**
1. Your HQ was destroyed and relocated to outer ring
2. You want to get back to your alliance hive
3. **Use the Enemy Buster menu before Day 6 ends:**
   - Teleport to enemy state (free via Enemy Buster menu)
   - Immediately teleport back to your own state (free via Enemy Buster menu)
   - You're now back in your original state

4. **Now use a regular teleport item to return to hive**
   - OR wait until you have teleport available
   - This gets you back home without wasting expensive teleports

**Why this works:**
- Enemy Buster menu teleports are FREE during the event
- You can use this to return to your state for free
- Then use regular teleport to get back to hive position
- Smart way to recover from HQ destruction without cost

**Time limit:** Only works during Day 6 event! After event ends, Enemy Buster menu closes.

## Your Day 6 Action Plan

### BEFORE Day 6 Starts (Saturday 0:00 Server Time):
- [ ] Put on a shield when you go to sleep during reset! This is crucial for all!
- [ ] Decide your strategy: Active Hunting, Shield with Reinforcement, or Full Shield
- [ ] **Buy 8-hour shields if hunting** (for ALL power levels!)
- [ ] Buy 24-hour shields only if using Strategy 2 or 3
- [ ] Check your healing speedups (do you have enough if hunting?)
- [ ] Check your gas supply (needed for HQ attacks)
- [ ] **Spend free resources on construction** (resources NOT in warehouse!)
- [ ] Empty your base of loose resources to become less attractive target
- [ ] Coordinate with alliance in chat
- [ ] Have enough troops ready
- [ ] **Plan to shield when offline - critical for all hunters!**

**IMPORTANT: Resource Management Before Day 6**

Your warehouse protects resources, but **free resources** (not in warehouse) are vulnerable to looting!

**Before Day 6:**
1. Check how many resources are outside your warehouse
2. Spend these free resources on building upgrades if possible
3. Start expensive construction projects to use up loose resources
4. This makes you a less attractive target for enemy looters
5. Resources in your warehouse are protected - only free resources get looted

**Strategy:** The fewer free resources you have, the less valuable you are as a target!

### STARTING Day 6 (Saturday 0:00):

**If Active Hunting (Strategy 1 - All Power Levels):**
1. **Activate 8-hour shield first** - protect your base
2. Scout enemy alliance members (find appropriate targets for your power)
3. Go online, hunt for 1-2 hours
4. **Shield again when done or going offline**
5. Strong players: Use TvT or HQ attacks
6. Medium/weak players: Target farm accounts and weaker enemies
7. Keep healing speedups ready
8. Balance points with looting opportunities
9. Repeat cycle: Online ‚Üí Hunt ‚Üí Shield

**If Shield with Reinforcement (Strategy 2 - Passive):**
1. Activate 24-hour shield immediately
2. Join strong alliance member's HQ as reinforcement
3. Earn passive points when they get attacked
4. Stay protected while contributing
5. No need to be actively online

**If Full Shield (Strategy 3 - Conservation):**
1. Activate 24-hour shield immediately
2. Stay shielded all day
3. Don't participate in any combat
4. Save all resources for next week
5. Accept minimal/zero rewards

## What NOT to Do on Day 6

- ‚ùå **DON'T forget to shield**
- ‚ùå **DON'T attack without checking power levels** - Easy way to lose troops
- ‚ùå **DON'T overcommit against superior opponents** - Accept some fights aren't winnable
- ‚ùå **DON'T use resources saved for next week** - If matched badly, conserve for better weeks
- ‚ùå **DON'T forget to shield!!!** (In case you didn't hear me earlier)

## Competitive Targets

**Active Hunting (Strategy 1):**

*Experienced Hunters:*
- **Casual combat:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points
- **Strong combat:** 1,500,000 - 3,000,000 points
- **Top fighters:** 4,000,000+ points
- **MVP candidates:** 6,000,000+ points

*Learning Hunters (All Power Levels):*
- **First-time hunters:** 50,000 - 200,000 points (great start!)
- **Improving hunters:** 200,000 - 500,000 points
- **Confident hunters:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points

**Shield with Reinforcement (Strategy 2):**
- **Reinforcement strategy:** 100,000 - 500,000 points
- **Limited participation:** 200,000 - 800,000 points

**Full Shield (Strategy 3):**
- **No participation:** 0 - 50,000 points (minimal/zero rewards)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not having a shield when day starts and you are stil in bed** - You are probably f*cked
1. **Attacking without scouting** - Walking into stronger opponents
2. **Not having healing speedups ready** - Massive healing costs without speedups
3. **Attacking during low alliance activity** - No backup when needed
4. **Not using shields between hunts** - Getting attacked while offline
5. **Forgetting to shield when going offline** - Losing resources unnecessarily
6. **Not learning to hunt** - Missing combat experience and growth opportunities
7. **Attacking randomly** - Target selection matters! Scout first
8. **Overcommitting in unwinnable weeks** - Sometimes strategic retreat is smart
9. **Sending troops more than 30 seconds from HQ** - Can't recall in time if threatened
10. **Not spending free resources before Day 6** - Becoming attractive looting target
11. **Forgetting about War Frenzy** - Can't shield for 10 minutes after combat
12. **Panicking when hit once** - One attack isn't a disaster, shield after multiple hits

## The Valor Medal Rewards

**Why Day 6 is unique:**

Normal days: Hero fragments in chests
Day 6: **Valor Medals** in chests

**Valor Medal value:**
- Trade for orange equipment in Merit Shop
- Premium equipment otherwise hard to acquire
- Makes Day 6 rewards worth fighting for

**Even if you score low, try to unlock some chests for the medals!**

## Alliance Coordination

**Critical for Day 6:**
- Communicate target selection in chat
- Call for reinforcements when needed
- Coordinate territory attack timing
- Share enemy scouting information
- Celebrate victories together
- Support each other through defeats

**Leadership roles (R4/R5):**
- Identify primary targets
- Coordinate mass attacks
- Call strategic retreats if needed
- Manage morale
- Make go/no-go decisions for risky fights

## The "Hopeless Week" Decision

**Sometimes matchmaking gives you an impossibly strong opponent.**

**You have two valid options:**

### Option 1: Strategic Conservation (Full Shield)
1. Recognize the power gap early
2. Coordinate resource conservation
3. Shield on Day 6
4. Save everything for next week
5. Accept this week as a strategic skip

**This is smart strategy, not giving up!** Better to save resources for a winnable week than deplete everything in an unwinnable fight.

### Option 2: Hunt for Personal Growth (Active Hunting)

**Even in hopeless weeks, you can still score points and grow!**

**The key insight: You don't need to beat the enemy alliance to benefit from Day 6!**

- Attack ANY player in enemy state (not just enemy alliance)
- Farm accounts and weak players = 1x points (still counts!)
- Enemy alliance members = 5x points (if you find weak ones)
- Focus on learning and looting, not alliance victory
- Build combat skills for future weeks
- Gather resources to accelerate growth

**Strategy for hopeless weeks:**
1. Use 8-hour shields (protect yourself)
2. Hunt weaker targets across entire enemy state
3. Avoid strong enemy alliance members
4. Focus on farm accounts and inactive players
5. Loot resources for YOUR growth, not alliance victory
6. Accept you won't win the alliance matchup
7. Still gain personal progression benefits

**Remember:** Alliance Duel victory ‚â† Personal progression. Even if your alliance loses badly, YOU can still grow stronger through smart hunting!

## Risk vs. Reward Analysis

**Active Hunting (Strategy 1 - Recommended):**
- ‚úÖ Learn combat mechanics
- ‚úÖ Gain combat experience
- ‚úÖ Loot resources to grow faster
- ‚úÖ Moderate to high points (depending on skill/power)
- ‚úÖ Build skills for future weeks
- ‚úÖ Resource looting opportunities
- ‚ùå Some troop losses (learning cost)
- ‚ùå Gas consumption
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use 8-hour shields between hunts

**Shield with Reinforcement (Strategy 2 - Passive):**
- ‚úÖ Moderate points (via reinforcement)
- ‚úÖ Protected base (shielded)
- ‚úÖ Lower costs
- ‚úÖ Zero risk approach
- ‚ùå Learn nothing about combat
- ‚ùå Miss looting opportunities
- ‚ùå Moderate chest rewards

**Full Shield (Strategy 3 - Conservation):**
- ‚úÖ Zero losses, maximum resource conservation
- ‚úÖ Save everything for next week
- ‚úÖ Strategic choice in hopeless matchups
- ‚ùå Minimal/zero chest rewards
- ‚ùå No points, no learning, no loot
- ‚ùå Miss all Day 6 Valor Medals

**Recommendation:** Even weak players should try hunting! The learning and looting benefits outweigh the costs.

## Final Reminder

**Day 6 = Combat Day = Starts Saturday 0:00 Server Time!**

**This day is different from all others:**
1. Starts Saturday 0:00 (normal day start)
2. Rewards combat instead of resources
3. Gives Valor Medals instead of hero fragments
4. **Learning opportunity:** Even weak players should hunt!
5. **Shield management crucial:** Use 8-hour shields between hunts

**Choose YOUR strategy:**
- **Want to learn and grow?** Active Hunting (Strategy 1) - Hunt at your level with 8-hour shields!
- **Prefer passive play?** Shield with Reinforcement (Strategy 2) - Safe points with zero risk
- **Hopeless matchup?** Full Shield (Strategy 3) - Save everything for next week

**Recommendation:** Hunt and learn! Even small victories teach valuable combat skills and provide looted resources. Use 8-hour shields to stay safe between hunting sessions.

**Remember:** Shield when offline, hunt when online! This is the final day - finish strong and smarter!
