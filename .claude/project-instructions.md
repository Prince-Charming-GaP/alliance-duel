# Project Instructions: Alliance Duel Guide for Last Z: Survival Shooter

## Project Purpose
Creating a comprehensive guide for Alliance Duel in the game Last Z: Survival Shooter to share with alliance members.

## Core Requirements

### Content Standards
- **Accuracy**: Information must be accurate and up-to-date
- **Non-redundant**: Single source of truth - no duplicate information
- **Output format**: Markdown
- **Navigation**: Add markdown links between published documents for easy navigation (exclude todo/ documents)

### Workflow Rules
1. **Research First**: Thorough research and fact-checking required before ANY alterations
2. **Todo Folder**: The `todo/` folder contains documents that are NOT ready yet
3. **Verification**: Documents remain in `todo/` until verified and ready for publication
4. **No Assumptions**: Never alter content without verifying accuracy first

### File Structure
```
/alliance-duel/
├── .claude/                    # Project instructions (this folder)
├── todo/                       # Work-in-progress documents (NOT ready)
├── 00_general_introduction.md  # Published content
├── 01_day1_modded_vehicle.md   # Published content
└── [future published content]
```

## Working with Content
- Always verify game mechanics and point values before making changes
- Maintain consistency across all documents
- Keep information current with game updates
- Eliminate redundancy between documents when consolidating
- Add navigation links at the top and bottom of each document:
  - Top: Link back to previous document (e.g., "← Back to General Introduction")
  - Bottom: Link to next document or indicate "Coming Soon" for unpublished content
  - Format: `**[← Back to Document](filename.md)** | **Next: [Document Name](filename.md)**`

## Goal
Create a single, comprehensive, accurate guide that alliance members can trust for Alliance Duel strategy and tactics.
