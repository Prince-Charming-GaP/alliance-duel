# Project Instructions: Alliance Duel Guide for Last Z: Survival Shooter

## Project Purpose
Creating a comprehensive guide for Alliance Duel in the game Last Z: Survival Shooter to share with alliance members.

## Core Requirements

### Content Standards
- **Accuracy**: Information must be accurate and up-to-date
- **Non-redundant**: Single source of truth - no duplicate information
- **Output format**: Markdown
- **Navigation**: Add markdown links between published documents for easy navigation (exclude todo/ documents)

### Workflow Rules
1. **Research First**: Thorough research and fact-checking required before ANY alterations
2. **Todo Folder**: The `todo/` folder contains documents that are NOT ready yet
3. **Verification**: Documents remain in `todo/` until verified and ready for publication
4. **No Assumptions**: Never alter content without verifying accuracy first

### File Structure
```
/alliance-duel/
├── .claude/                    # Project instructions (this folder)
├── todo/                       # Work-in-progress documents (NOT ready)
├── 00_general_introduction.md  # Published content
├── 01_day1_modded_vehicle.md   # Published content
└── [future published content]
```

## Working with Content
- Always verify game mechanics and point values before making changes
- Maintain consistency across all documents
- Keep information current with game updates
- Eliminate redundancy between documents when consolidating
- Add navigation links at the top and bottom of each document:
  - Top: Link back to previous document (e.g., "← Back to General Introduction")
  - Bottom: Link to next document or indicate "Coming Soon" for unpublished content
  - Format: `**[← Back to Document](filename.md)** | **Next: [Document Name](filename.md)**`

## Git Configuration
- **Local repository identity** (not global):
  - Author: Prince Charming
  - Email: prince@charming.gap
- This anonymizes commits for public sharing
- Global git config remains unchanged (user's personal identity)
- All commit messages should be clean (no Claude Code attribution or co-author lines)

## Research Sources
Reliable sources for verification (in order of preference):
1. **lastzdata.com** - Most comprehensive data source
2. **lastwarztutorial.com** - Detailed guides and mechanics
3. **bacons-last-z-guide.fandom.com** - Community wiki
4. **Reddit r/LastZShooterRun** - Player experiences and mechanics clarification
5. In-game verification by user when documentation is unavailable

## Key Game Mechanics Verified
- **Server Time:** GMT-2 universal for all players/servers
- **Preparation Period:** 0:00-0:05 Server Time (no points counted)
- **Golden Hour:** 8:00-12:00 and 20:00-24:00 Server Time (Theme 3 always matches Alliance Duel day)
- **Radar Stacking:** Stack to 1 below maximum capacity (varies by building level: 34/35, 39/40, 49/50)
- **Construction Speedups:** 107 points per 1-minute + 3 points per 10 power consumed
- **Orange Bounties:** 111,000 points (with full research) - always refresh until orange
- **Orange Refugees:** 107,000 points (with full research) - recruitment costs: 500/2,000/5,000 tickets
- **Super Upgrade Buff:** One-time 30-minute 2x blueprint XP when unlocking Hercules/Destroyer/Destroyer EX
- **Modification Rating Levels:** Intern → Novice → Veteran → Elite → Expert → Master → Grandmaster → Modding Overlord

## Important Notes from User
- **"Orange or nothing"** - Only complete orange-tier tasks (green/blue/purple = minimal/zero points)
- **Don't complete radar events immediately** - Stack them for theme days where they give points
- **Super Upgrade Buff timing** - Should be activated during Golden Hour on Day 1, not before event starts
- **Pre-stage upgrades** - Start expensive upgrades before Day 2 to claim points when event begins
- **Refugee refresh strategy** - Use "Try Your Luck" once (500 tickets), then REFRESH for new batch rather than re-rolling same pool

## Goal
Create a single, comprehensive, accurate guide that alliance members can trust for Alliance Duel strategy and tactics.
