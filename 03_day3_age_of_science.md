Wednesday is **Day 3: Age of Science**. This is **THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY** of Alliance Duel! Not only does this day have massive point potential from research and badges, but it's also when you should unlock Premium Rewards, Super Rewards, and One More Research - getting BOTH the unlock benefits AND massive points from the badge consumption itself.

## What Gives Points on Day 3

### üî• MASSIVE VALUE (Priority!)
1. **Badge Consumption** - 87 points per badge (20,000 badges = 1,740,000 points!)
2. **Research Speedups** - 65 points per 1-minute + 2 points per 10 tech power
3. **Orange S-Rank Intercity Trade** - 163,300 points per completion
4. **Tech Power Gains** - From research completion

### ‚ùå NO VALUE
- Blue/Green/Purple Intercity Trade - **0 POINTS**
- A-Rank Intercity Trade (even if orange!) - **0 POINTS**
- Only **Orange S-Rank trucks** give points!

## Week-Long Preparation Strategy

Day 3 success starts with proper preparation throughout the entire week. Here's your Monday-Tuesday game plan:

### What to Do Before Day 3:

**Monday & Tuesday (Days 1-2):**
- DO NOT research any badge-consuming techs (Alliance Recognition, Hero Training, Military Strategies)
- Focus Lab 1 on badge research but don't start them yet - just queue them up mentally
- Use Lab 2 for non-badge research (Shelter, Development, HQ Management)
- Save ALL research speedups - don't use them on Day 1 or Day 2
- Collect badges from daily tasks, events, and mission rewards
- Save trade contracts and refresh items for Day 3 intercity trades
- Note which researches you want to complete on Day 3

**Why This Matters:**

If you research Premium Rewards on Monday:
- You spend 5,000 badges
- You get 0 Alliance Duel points
- You unlock chests (good, but...)

If you wait and research Premium Rewards on Day 3:
- You spend the same 5,000 badges
- You get 435,000 Alliance Duel points
- You unlock the same chests
- **Same cost, massive bonus points!**

**The Golden Rule:** Any research that costs badges should ONLY be done on Day 3 during Alliance Duel.

### Pre-Staging Research:

**Advanced Strategy:** On Tuesday evening (late Day 2):
1. Start a long, expensive badge-consuming research
2. Let it run naturally through the night
3. Finish it with speedups during Day 3 Golden Hour
4. Get points for: badge consumption + speedup usage + tech power gain + Full Preparedness rewards

Example: Start a 48-hour Hero Training research at 10pm Tuesday, then speed it up during Day 3's 8pm Golden Hour.

## THE CRITICAL STRATEGY: Research Premium/Super/One More Rewards TODAY

**This is the single most important decision in Alliance Duel!**

### Why Research These on Day 3?

**Benefit #1: Unlock Better Rewards**
- Premium Rewards ‚Üí Unlocks reward chests 4-6
- Super Rewards ‚Üí Unlocks reward chests 7-9
- One More Research ‚Üí Unlocks additional reward chest

**Benefit #2: MASSIVE Points from Badge Consumption**

These researches consume thousands of badges, and at 87 points per badge on Day 3, this generates enormous points!

**Example:**
- Premium Rewards costs ~5,000 badges
- 5,000 badges √ó 87 points = 435,000 points
- PLUS you unlock chests 4-6 forever
- **Same investment, double benefit!**

### Research Priority Order (Day 3):

1. **Event Expert** (+100% bonus points - DOUBLES everything!)
2. **Premium Rewards** (Unlocks chests 4-6 + badge points)
3. **Super Rewards** (Unlocks chests 7-9 + badge points)
4. **One More Research** (Extra chest + badge points)
5. **Incentive - Development** (+100% construction points - helps future Day 2s)
6. **Event King** (+200% bonus points - TRIPLES everything!)

**If you haven't researched Event Expert yet, start with that FIRST!** It doubles all your points going forward.

## Badge Consumption Strategy

**Badges are 87 POINTS EACH on Day 3!**

This is THE reason to save badges all week. Whether you spend them today or next week doesn't matter for your progression, but spending them during Day 3 gives you massive free points.

### How to Maximize Badge Points:

1. **Save ALL badges all week** (don't research badge-consuming techs Mon-Tue)
2. **On Day 3, research ONLY badge-consuming techs:**
   - Alliance Recognition tree (Event Expert, Event King, Premium/Super Rewards)
   - Hero Training techs
   - Military Strategies techs
3. **Use both research labs** - One on badge techs (for Day 3), one on non-badge techs (other days)

**Advanced Strategy:**
- Start expensive research late Day 2
- Finish with speedups on Day 3 Golden Hour
- Get speedup points + power points + Full Preparedness rewards simultaneously

## Intercity Trade Strategy

**ONLY Orange S-Rank Trucks Give Points!**

This is extremely strict:
- Orange S-Rank truck: ‚úÖ 163,300 POINTS
- Orange A-Rank truck: ‚ùå 0 POINTS
- Blue/Purple/Green (any rank): ‚ùå 0 POINTS

### How to Get Orange S-Rank Trucks:

1. Open Intercity Trade
2. Check truck color AND rank
3. If not Orange S-Rank ‚Üí **Use trade contract to refresh**
4. Keep refreshing until Orange S-Rank appears
5. Complete ONLY Orange S-Rank trades

**Yes, this costs trade contracts and/or diamonds. It's worth it.** The point difference between Orange S-Rank and anything else is literally 100% (points vs. no points).

## Your Day 3 Action Plan

### BEFORE Day 3 starts:
- [ ] Count your total badges (this is your point potential!)
- [ ] Save ALL research speedups (don't use today!)
- [ ] Check which Alliance Recognition techs you haven't researched yet
- [ ] Prepare trade contracts for intercity trade refreshing
- [ ] Note your current tech power

### STARTING 0:00 am Server Time:
1. **WAIT 5 MINUTES!** (0:00-0:05 am server time is preparation period - nothing counts!)
2. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (8:00-12:00 or 20:00-24:00 Server Time)
3. **Research Event Expert first** (if not already done)
4. **Research Premium Rewards** (unlocks chests 4-6 + massive badge points!)
5. **Research Super Rewards** (unlocks chests 7-9 + more badge points!)
6. **Research One More Research** (extra chest + badge points!)
7. **Research other badge-consuming techs** (Alliance Recognition, Hero Training)
8. **Use research speedups** to complete/accelerate research
9. **Refresh intercity trade for Orange S-Rank trucks**
10. **Complete Orange S-Rank intercity trades**

## Golden Hour Timing

**Guaranteed Golden Hours (when Full Preparedness overlaps):**
- **Morning window:** 8:00-12:00 Server Time
- **Evening window:** 20:00-24:00 Server Time (last window before reset)

**CRITICAL:** Starting research and using speedups during Golden Hour gives you:
- Alliance Duel points (research speedups + badge consumption)
- Full Preparedness rewards
- Tech power progression
- Chest unlocks (for Premium/Super/One More Rewards)

**This is 4x benefit from one action!**

## The Two-Lab Strategy

**Lab Strategy for Maximum Efficiency:**

**Lab 1:** Badge-consuming research
- Alliance Recognition (Day 3 focus)
- Hero Training (Day 3 focus)
- Military Strategies (Day 3 focus)

**Lab 2:** Non-badge research
- Shelter techs
- HQ Management
- Rapid Growth
- Development

This lets you save badges for Day 3 while still progressing in other areas during the week.

## Research Time Efficiency

Maximizing your Day 3 score requires smart timing and research selection. Here's how to optimize your research strategy:

### Short Research vs. Long Research

**Short Research (under 24 hours):**
- Pros: Complete multiple researches during the day
- Pros: More badge consumption opportunities
- Pros: Easier to time with Golden Hour windows
- Cons: Lower individual speedup point values

**Long Research (24+ hours):**
- Pros: Massive speedup points when completed
- Pros: High tech power gains
- Cons: Requires large speedup stockpile
- Strategy: Pre-stage these on Day 2, finish on Day 3

### Optimal Day 3 Research Flow

**Morning (8:00-12:00 Golden Hour):**
1. Start with short badge-consuming research (2-8 hours)
2. Complete them immediately with speedups during Golden Hour
3. This gives you: badge points + speedup points + Full Preparedness rewards
4. Cycle through 2-3 short researches in this window

**Afternoon (12:00-20:00 non-Golden Hour):**
1. Start medium-length research (8-12 hours)
2. Let them run naturally (save speedups for Golden Hour)
3. Queue up your next batch of research
4. Do intercity trade refreshes and completions

**Evening (20:00-24:00 Golden Hour):**
1. Complete any running research with speedups
2. Start and finish remaining badge-consuming research
3. Final push for maximum points
4. This is your last chance for Golden Hour multiplier!

### Golden Hour Speedup Strategy

**Why Golden Hour Matters for Speedups:**
- 1-minute speedup = 65 Alliance Duel points
- PLUS Full Preparedness rewards (extra loot!)
- Same speedup, double benefit

**Recommended Approach:**
- Save 80% of your speedups for Golden Hour windows
- Use 20% outside Golden Hour if needed to keep researching
- Prioritize completing large research during Golden Hour (more speedup points)

### Research Value Calculation

Understanding which research gives best value helps prioritize:

**High-Value Research (Badge Cost + Long Duration):**
- Premium Rewards: 5,000 badges + long research time = 435,000+ badge points + massive speedup points
- Super Rewards: Similar massive value
- Event King: Expensive but triples future event points

**Medium-Value Research (Badge Cost + Medium Duration):**
- Hero Training techs: 2,000-4,000 badges each
- Military Strategies: Similar badge costs
- Good for filling time between major researches

**Strategy for Limited Resources:**

If you only have 10,000 badges total:
1. Premium Rewards (5,000 badges) - permanent unlock
2. Two Hero Training researches (2,500 badges each) - progression value
3. Save remaining speedups for Golden Hour completion

If you have 20,000+ badges:
1. Premium Rewards (5,000 badges)
2. Super Rewards (if unlocked, ~7,000 badges)
3. Event King (if affordable, ~8,000 badges)
4. Fill remaining time with Hero Training/Military Strategies

### The 24-Hour Reality Check

**You can't research everything in one day!** Be strategic:

**Realistic Day 3 Completion:**
- 3-5 major badge-consuming researches
- 4-8 shorter researches (if cycling quickly)
- 4 Orange S-Rank intercity trades
- All speedups used during Golden Hours

**Unrealistic Expectations:**
- Completing 10+ major researches
- Using 50,000+ badges (research takes time!)
- Finishing entire Alliance Recognition tree

**Pro Tip:** Start your most important research first (Event Expert, Premium Rewards). Don't save the best for last - you might run out of time!

## What NOT to Do on Day 3

- ‚ùå **DON'T complete non-Orange-S-Rank intercity trade** - Literally 0 points
- ‚ùå **DON'T use construction speedups** - Day 2 only!
- ‚ùå **DON'T spend hero fragments** - Save for Day 4!
- ‚ùå **DON'T train troops** - Save for Day 5!
- ‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches** - Day 1 only!
- ‚ùå **DON'T research non-badge techs today** - Save those for non-event days

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 2,500,000 - 4,000,000 points
- **Top performers:** 5,000,000 - 8,000,000 points
- **MVP candidates:** 10,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** Badge savings! Players with 20,000+ badges can easily score 1.7M+ from badges alone.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not researching Premium/Super/One More Rewards on Day 3** - Missing the double benefit!
2. **Spending badges on non-event days** - Wasting 87 points per badge
3. **Completing non-Orange-S-Rank trades** - Wasting trade opportunities for 0 points
4. **Using research speedups before event** - Losing massive point potential
5. **Not waiting for Golden Hour** - Missing Full Preparedness double rewards
6. **Researching non-badge techs on Day 3** - Save those for regular days

## The Badge Savings Reality

**"I only have 5,000 badges saved, is that enough?"**

YES! Here's the math:

- 5,000 badges √ó 87 points = 435,000 points
- Plus research speedup points
- Plus tech power gain points
- Plus intercity trade points

Even "small" badge savings create substantial scores.

**"I have 20,000 badges saved!"**

EXCELLENT! That's:
- 20,000 badges √ó 87 points = 1,740,000 points
- Just from badges alone
- Before any other activities!

This is why saving badges all week matters so much.

## Alliance Coordination

- Share in chat when you complete major research (morale boost!)
- Help teammates understand why Day 3 research unlocks are critical
- Coordinate timing for collective Golden Hour push
- Celebrate milestone research completions together

## Premium/Super/One More Rewards Investment

**"Should I really research these today?"**

**ABSOLUTELY YES, if you can!** Here's why:

**Short-term benefit:**
- Massive badge consumption points TODAY
- Helps alliance win THIS week

**Long-term benefit:**
- Unlocks higher reward chests FOREVER
- Every future Alliance Duel gives better rewards
- One-time investment, permanent benefit

**When to research:**
- Premium Rewards: ASAP if you can afford it
- Super Rewards: After Premium (higher badge cost)
- One More Research: After Super (extra chest benefit)

Even if you can only afford Premium Rewards this week, do it! The chest unlock is permanent.

## Research Point Calculation

Understanding the point formula helps you maximize your score:

**Per research action:**
- 65 points per 1-minute speedup consumed
- 2 points per 10 tech power gained

**Example: Large Research**
- 72-hour research (4,320 minutes) = 280,800 speedup points
- Grants 10,000 tech power = 2,000 power points
- Total: 282,800 points from one research!

**With Event Expert/Event King:** These multipliers apply to the base points, making large researches even more valuable!

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Things to use on Day 3:**
- ‚úÖ ALL badges (through badge-consuming research)
- ‚úÖ ALL research speedups
- ‚úÖ Orange S-Rank intercity trade trucks (refresh until S-rank!)
- ‚úÖ Research Premium/Super/One More Rewards (if possible)

**Things to save:**
- üíæ Construction speedups (Day 2 was yesterday)
- üíæ Hero fragments and equipment (Day 4)
- üíæ Training speedups (Day 5)
- üíæ Combat resources (Day 6)

## Final Reminder

**Day 3 = Research Day = Badge Consumption Day = Chest Unlock Day**

This is the most important day because:
1. Badge consumption gives 87 points each (massive multiplier!)
2. You research Premium/Super/One More Rewards for permanent chest unlocks
3. You get points from both the badges AND the unlocks
4. Event Expert/Event King double/triple all your future points

**Strategy Summary:**
- Save ALL badges for today
- Research Premium/Super/One More Rewards TODAY
- Use ALL research speedups during Golden Hour
- Only complete Orange S-Rank intercity trades
- Research Event Expert/Event King if you haven't already

Tomorrow is our biggest scoring opportunity. Let's make it count!
