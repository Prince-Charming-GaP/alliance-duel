# State Ruler - General Introduction

---

State Ruler is Last Z's ultimate cross-server competition where four servers battle over 2-3 weeks in a double-elimination tournament. Unlike Alliance Duel where alliances compete, State Ruler unites all survivors from an entire server to fight as one faction against other servers.

Victory requires mastering both the week-long Preparation Phase that determines battlefield advantages and the intense Saturday Capital Clash where strategic coordination meets tactical execution.

## What is State Ruler?

State Ruler is a two-phase, server-wide competitive event that runs 2-3 weeks with four servers competing in a tournament format. Your entire server works together - all alliances united - to defeat enemy servers and claim the State Ruler crown.

The competition divides into two distinct phases:
- **Preparation Phase (Sunday-Friday):** Six days of point accumulation through daily events determines which server becomes Invader vs Defender
- **Capital Clash (Saturday):** Four-hour battle where servers fight for capital occupation and victory

## Tournament Structure

### Two-Round Double-Elimination Format

The tournament follows a **two-round, double-elimination structure** where all four matched servers compete twice with no early eliminations:

**Round 1:**
- Four servers matched randomly (not by power level)
- Two 1v1 matchups assigned randomly
- Winners advance to compete for 1st and 2nd place
- Losers battle for 3rd and 4th place

**Round 2:**
- Winners from Round 1 face each other for championship
- Losers from Round 1 compete for third place
- All four servers fight twice before final rankings

This structure ensures sustained competition throughout the event. Even servers losing Round 1 continue competing for better placement and rewards.

### Victory Conditions

State Ruler offers two paths to victory:

**Instant Victory:**
- First server to reach **100% capital occupation wins immediately**
- Battle ends the moment 100% is achieved
- No need to wait until 16:00 UTC deadline

**Percentage Victory:**
- If neither server reaches 100% by 16:00 UTC deadline
- Server with **highest occupation percentage wins**
- Even 51% vs 49% determines victory

This dual path creates strategic tension between aggressive full-occupation pushes and defensive percentage preservation.

### Random Matchmaking

**Servers are matched RANDOMLY** - not by power level, age, or strength. This creates unpredictable matchups where:
- Newer servers can face veteran states
- Coordination and strategy often trump raw power
- Every matchup presents unique challenges
- Preparation Phase performance matters more than server age

Sources confirm no power-balancing algorithms exist. Tournament matchups are truly random, making strategic preparation and execution the primary success factors.

## Event Timing

### Overall Timeline

**Total Duration:** 2-3 weeks depending on tournament scheduling
- Each round: Approximately 1 week
- Matching Period: Before Round 1 starts
- Break between rounds: Varies

### Weekly Schedule

**Preparation Phase: Sunday through Friday**
- Starts: Sunday at event beginning
- Ends: Friday Apocalypse Time
- Duration: 6 days total
- Purpose: Accumulate points to determine Invader/Defender roles

**Capital Clash: Saturday**
- 00:00 UTC: Invaders can teleport to defender territory
- 12:00 UTC: Capital buildings and turrets exit protection
- 12:00-16:00 UTC: Four-hour battle window
- 16:00 UTC: Battle ends, results determined

This compressed Saturday timeline creates intense pressure where every decision matters and coordination determines outcomes.

## Entry Requirements

**State Ruler has NO specific entry requirements:**

- No minimum Influence level
- No minimum HQ level
- No minimum power threshold
- No alliance membership restrictions
- No President/leadership position required

The event operates as **server-wide participation** where all players on matched servers can contribute regardless of individual strength. This inclusive design means even newer players impact outcomes through:
- Preparation Phase activities (truck raids, event participation)
- Battle day support roles (rallies, reinforcements, scouting)
- Resource donation and coordination support

Individual contributions scale based on capability - top 200 players earn Furylord points while everyone can plunder trucks or join rallies. This creates diverse contribution opportunities across the power spectrum.

## The Two Phases Explained

### Preparation Phase (Sunday-Friday)

The six-day preparation period determines which server gains the advantageous Invader role:

**Point Categories:**
- **Individual Points:** Alliance Duel rankings (6,000 pts/day for rank 1), Arena champion (20,000 pts), Full Preparedness champion (500 pts), enemy truck plundering (100 pts each)
- **Alliance Points:** Alliance Duel victories (30,000 pts per win)
- **State Points:** Furylord boss damage from top 200 players, plus 30,000 pt bonus for highest damage dealer

**The Formula:** Total State Score = Individual Points + Alliance Points + State Points

**The Stakes:** Higher-scoring server becomes Invader (massive advantages), lower-scoring server becomes Defender (reactive position)

The Preparation Phase isn't just event grinding - it's a strategic battle to secure offensive advantages for Saturday.

### Capital Clash (Saturday)

The climactic four-hour battle determines tournament winners:

**Battle Mechanics:**
- Invaders teleport freely into defender territory
- Capital buildings accept maximum 10 troop garrisons each
- Four turrets provide tactical advantages
- Occupation progress bar advances through continuous troop presence
- First to 100% wins instantly, otherwise highest % at 16:00 UTC wins

**Combat System:**
- HQ durability destruction: 10 points per durability point
- Zone multipliers reward capital-focused combat
- Both kills and deaths generate points in capital/turret zones
- Rally coordination enables concentrated strikes
- Hospital management prevents permanent troop losses

The Saturday battle transforms point accumulation into direct PvP combat where tactical execution and coordination determine victory.

## Invader vs Defender Roles

### Invader Advantages

The server with higher Preparation Phase points becomes Invader and gains:

- **Free unlimited teleportation** into enemy territory
- **Initiative control** - choose when, where, and who to attack
- **Unrestricted targeting** of any unshielded enemy player
- **Tempo dictation** forcing defenders into reactive positions

### Defender Advantages

The lower-scoring server becomes Defender with compensating benefits:

- **Home field advantage** fighting in familiar territory
- **No teleportation costs** already positioned defensively
- **300% reinforcement march speed** for rapid response
- **Default capital ownership** - invaders must reach 100% to win
- **TVT point generation** earning points even when defending

Both roles can win, but require dramatically different strategies and coordination approaches.

## Why State Ruler Matters

**Server Rewards:**
- First place: State Ruler title, two new official positions, exclusive diamond mines
- All placements: Server-wide rewards scaling by rank
- Double-elimination ensures everyone fights twice for better rewards

**Personal Rewards:**
- Nine progressive reward chests requiring 2.25 million total points
- Valor Medals for purchasing orange equipment
- Diamonds, skill books, enhancement alloys, resources

**Prestige:**
- State Ruler title = most prestigious designation in Last Z
- Server-wide recognition and bragging rights
- Advancement to next tournament round

## Success Principles

State Ruler rewards:

1. **Preparation discipline** - consistent daily event participation compounds into decisive point advantages
2. **Strategic coordination** - server unity matters more than individual power
3. **Resource management** - stockpiling and timing determine sustained combat capability
4. **Tactical execution** - Saturday coordination separates victory from defeat
5. **Adaptability** - rigid plans fail when opponents adjust

The Preparation Phase determines battlefield advantages, but Capital Clash execution determines champions. Master both phases to claim the State Ruler crown.
