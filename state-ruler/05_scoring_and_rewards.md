State Ruler rewards both personal performance and server-wide success. Understanding scoring mechanics and reward structures helps balance individual optimization with collective victory goals.

## Personal Ranking Rewards

### Nine Progressive Reward Chests

**Total Points Required: 2.25 Million**

The personal reward system distributes nine progressive reward chests unlocking as you accumulate points during Capital Clash.

**Chest Contents:**
- **Valor Medals:** Purchase orange equipment in Merit Shop
- **Diamonds:** Premium currency for speedups, shields, and items
- **Orange Skill Books:** Highest tier skill upgrades for heroes
- **Badge Enhancement Alloys:** Gear improvement materials
- **Resources:** Wood, food, Zent, electricity

While exact quantities per individual chest tier remain undocumented in public guides, rewards scale progressively with higher tiers providing better quantities and quality.

### Point Generation Efficiency

**Ranked by Point-Per-Action Value:**

**1. HQ Durability Destruction (Highest Efficiency):**
- 10 points per 1 durability point reduced
- Full HQ destruction: 360,000-520,000 points
- Doubled durability loss in capital zones
- Target lower-level bases (HQ 15-25) for minimal risk
- Methodical farming generates massive points safely

**2. Capital Area Combat (High Yield):**
- Enhanced point multipliers
- Rewards for BOTH kills and deaths in these zones
- Strategic sacrifice acceptable
- Aggressive combat encouraged

**3. Turret Zone Combat:**
- Elevated multipliers
- Points for kills plus strategic value
- Both offensive and defensive engagement rewarded

**4. Enemy Troop Kills:**
- Inside capital: High yield per kill
- Outside capital: Lower but cumulative
- Continuous engagement throughout battle
- Compounds over four-hour window

**5. Knockout Bonuses:**
- +50,000 points for HQ destruction in Capital/Level 6 zones
- Significant bonus encouraging zone-focused attacks
- Multiple knockouts compound quickly

### Strategic Sacrifice Mechanic

**Unique Reward System:**

Troop losses in capital/turret zones generate personal points:
- Encourages aggressive capital defense over passive positioning
- Even casualties contribute to personal score
- Strategic sacrifice viable when defending critical zones
- TVT battles fastest defensive point earning method

This creates tactical scenarios where aggressive engagement outweighs preservation - fighting in high-value zones generates rewards even through losses.

## Server Ranking Rewards

### Tournament Placement Structure

**Four Final Placements with Corresponding Rewards:**

The two-round tournament structure creates four distinct final rankings:
- **First Place:** Championship server
- **Second Place:** Runner-up server
- **Third Place:** Consolation bracket winner
- **Fourth Place:** Consolation bracket runner-up

While sources confirm better server performance correlates with better server-wide rewards, specific reward tables detailing exact quantities remain undocumented in accessible public materials.

## Influence Level and Renewable Resources

### Influence System Mechanics

**Key Metric for Resource Generation:**

Influence Level operates through Season 2 system:
- **Increases by raising number and levels of Tiles**
- Tiles obtained through Structures (Virus Labs, Land Agencies)
- **Critical:** Structures themselves don't provide influence - only tiles do

### Renewable Reward Distribution

**Every Eight Hours Based on Current Influence Level:**

Provides automatically:
- **Badges:** Research upgrades, tech tree advancement, event multipliers
- **Zent:** Season 2 structure upgrades, building enhancements, progression systems

Higher Influence tiers generate more rewards per cycle, creating compounding advantages over time.

### Tile Influence Scaling

**Dramatic Value Progression:**

**Level 1 Tiles:**
- 5 influence
- 30 resources/hour
- 25,000 recommended power

**Level 15 Tiles:**
- 330 influence
- 1,680 resources/hour
- 24,600,000 recommended power

The exponential scaling rewards tile development investment - higher-level tiles provide dramatically better returns.
