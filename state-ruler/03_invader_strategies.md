**[← Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)** | **[← Capital Clash Mechanics](02_capital_clash_mechanics.md)**

---

The Invader role transforms Preparation Phase victory into decisive battlefield advantages. Free teleportation, initiative control, and unrestricted targeting create opportunities for coordinated offensive dominance.

Success requires exploiting mobility advantages while managing the dual challenge of attacking enemy capital and defending your own.

## Invader Advantages

### Transformative Strategic Benefits

**Free Unlimited Teleportation:**
- Zero diamond cost (normally 500-1,500 per teleport)
- Saves tens of thousands of diamonds across battle day
- Enables rapid repositioning without economic penalty
- Withdraw from unfavorable engagements freely
- Concentrated strikes on weak points

**Initiative Control:**
- Choose engagement timing (attack during enemy offline periods)
- Select target locations (exploit defensive weaknesses)
- Concentrate force where needed (overwhelming local superiority)
- Dictate battle tempo (defenders react to your movements)

**Unrestricted Targeting:**
- Strike any unshielded player regardless of location
- HQ farming opportunities against weaker opponents
- Avoid heavily fortified positions
- Adapt tactics real-time based on defensive responses

**Strategic Flexibility:**
- Reposition based on battlefield conditions
- Exploit gaps in enemy defense
- Coordinate multi-pronged attacks
- Withdraw and relocate instantly

### Invader Disadvantages

**Despite Offensive Role, Challenges Remain:**

**Must Defend Own Capital:**
- Invaders can be counter-attacked
- Requires force split between offense and defense
- Defenders may raid invader home state during battle

**Resource Intensity:**
- Sustained operations demand significant speedups
- Healing items for continuous combat
- Shields for emergency protection
- Four-hour window requires deep resource stockpiles

**Time Pressure:**
- Must achieve 100% occupation or maintain percentage lead
- Four-hour deadline creates urgency
- Cannot afford prolonged stalemates

**Coordination Burden:**
- Synchronized attacks across multiple alliances
- Real-time tactical adjustments
- Communication essential
- Individual excellence insufficient without team coordination

## Pre-Battle Positioning (00:00-12:00 UTC)

### The 12-Hour Preparation Window

**Invaders Can Teleport Starting Saturday 00:00:**

This 12-hour window before capital protection drops enables thorough preparation without combat pressure.

**Critical Preparation Tasks:**

**Mass Teleportation:**
- All offensive players teleport into enemy territory
- Coordinate teleportation zones to avoid overcrowding
- Position near capital areas but not too concentrated
- Spread across multiple approach angles

**Target Scouting and Marking:**
- Identify priority HQ targets (especially HQ 15-25)
- Mark lower-level bases for farming
- Scout heavily defended positions to avoid
- Create target lists preventing attack overlap

**Rally Point Establishment:**
- Set up near capital zones
- Coordinate rally leaders positioning
- Ensure rally square locations don't overlap
- Clear approach routes to capital

**Target Assignment Distribution:**
- Alliance A: Turret 1 + Eastern HQ farming route
- Alliance B: Turret 2 + Northern HQ farming route
- Alliance C: Turret 3 + Capital rallies
- Prevents wasted effort and overlapping attacks

**Force Organization:**
- Offensive teams for capital/turret attacks
- Home defense teams guarding invader capital
- HQ farming parties for personal points
- Support/healing rotation teams

### Communication Protocol Setup

**Establish Command Structure:**
- President/leadership provides overall strategy
- R4/R5 officers as tactical commanders per alliance
- Voice chat or messaging channels for real-time coordination
- Ping systems for priority target marking

**Create Coordination Systems:**
- Rally timer announcements (60 seconds before launch)
- Target assignment lists (who attacks what)
- Turret capture responsibility (which alliance per turret)
- Home defense rotation schedule

**Emergency Protocols:**
- What if home capital comes under attack?
- Procedure if turret capture fails
- Regroup locations if coordinated assault repelled
- Communication chain if leadership goes offline

## Attack Timing and Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Turret Capture (12:00-12:15 UTC)

**When Capital Protection Drops at 12:00, Immediate Turret Capture = Priority 1:**

**Why Turrets Matter:**
- Only three turrets exist (race dynamics)
- Each captured turret continuously auto-attacks enemy capital
- Eliminates defending troops without ongoing attacker commitment
- 2% garrison damage per turret per firing cycle
- Maximum 8% with all turrets held (unsustainable for defenders)

**Execution Strategy:**
- Assign specific alliances to each turret (clear responsibility)
- Launch simultaneous rallies on all three at 12:00
- Maximum 10 troops per turret makes capture manageable
- Maintain garrison presence after capture

**First 15 Minutes Critical:**
- Securing turrets early establishes attrition advantage
- Delays give defenders time to organize counter-rallies
- Turret control compounds throughout battle
- Changes strategic landscape immediately

### Phase 2: Peak Offensive (12:00-14:00 UTC)

**Two-Hour Maximum Pressure Window:**

**Primary Objectives:**
- Coordinated rallies on enemy capital (advance occupation)
- Continuous reinforcement rotation (maintain pressure)
- Simultaneous HQ farming for personal points
- Troop positioning in capital/turret zones (maximize kill credit)

**Rally Coordination:**
- Multiple rallies timed 1-2 seconds apart
- First rally hits full defenders
- Second rally encounters depleted resistance
- Overwhelming defender rotation timing

**HQ Farming Cycles:**
- Run continuously throughout Saturday
- Lower-level enemy HQs (15-25 ideal balance)
- Attack to reduce durability (monitor damage reports)
- Continue hitting without zeroing durability (prevents random teleport)
- Farm resources fully before moving to next target

**Capital Zone Positioning:**
- Station troops in capital/turret zones
- Earn points for kills AND deaths in these zones
- Strategic sacrifice acceptable for point generation
- Rotation ensures fresh troops continuously engaged

### Phase 3: Final Push (14:00-16:00 UTC)

**All Resources on Capital Progress Bar:**

**If 100% Occupation Achievable:**
- Concentrate everything on that goal
- Deploy remaining speedups for rapid reinforcement
- Heal troops immediately for redeployment
- Overwhelming force to capital structures

**If 100% Unreachable:**
- Maximize progress percentage before cutoff
- Highest percentage wins if neither reaches 100%
- Deploy remaining healing items
- Nothing reserved matters after 16:00

**Resource Depletion Phase:**
- Use all remaining speedups
- Deploy emergency healing items
- Activate final shields for home defense
- Leave nothing unused at deadline

## Coordination Tactics for Mass Attacks

### Rally Leadership Structure

**Prioritize Highest Rally Square Holders:**

Rally leaders should be players with:
- Maximum Rally Square level (highest troop capacity)
- Superior hero combinations (primary skills affect entire rally)
- Reliable participation and timing
- Communication discipline

**Rally Composition Optimization:**

**Rally Leader:**
- Provides primary hero skills to entire rally
- Stats affect all rally participants
- Choose combat-optimized heroes

**Rally Joiners:**
- Contribute "Expedition Skill" (top-right skill slot)
- Optimal mix: Offensive heroes (Jesse +25% damage) + Defensive heroes (Sergey durability)
- Balance between damage and survivability

### Communication Protocols

**Essential Coordination Elements:**

**Voice Chat or Messaging Channels:**
- Real-time coordination impossible through game chat alone
- Discord, Line, WhatsApp, or similar platforms
- Separate channels for offense/defense/farming

**Tactical Commander Designation:**
- R4/R5 officers as tactical commanders
- Clear chain of command
- Decision authority during battle

**Ping Systems for Target Marking:**
- Mark priority targets (capital structures, turrets, high-value HQs)
- Prevent attack overlap
- Coordinate simultaneous strikes

**Rally Timer Announcements:**
- "Turret 1 rally launching in 60 seconds"
- Gives joiners time to prepare
- Ensures maximum participation

**Target Assignment Lists:**
- Alliance A targets: Turret 1, Eastern HQ route
- Alliance B targets: Turret 2, Northern HQ route
- Alliance C targets: Capital rallies, Western HQ route
- Prevents wasted effort

### Multi-Alliance Coordination

**Unified Command Structure:**

The game treats all survivors from the same state as one faction:
- Alliance A won't fight Alliance B if both from State #1
- No friendly fire concerns
- Enables true cross-alliance coordination

**Presidents/Leadership Unite State Forces:**
- Single strategic plan across all alliances
- Coordinated timing for major pushes
- Resource sharing and target distribution
- Unified response to defensive threats

**Alliance-Specific Roles:**
- Top alliance: Capital assault teams
- Mid alliances: Turret capture and hold
- Lower alliances: HQ farming and support
- Utilizes each alliance's strengths

### "Engage Offline" Feature

**Auto-Join Rally Mechanic:**

After 60 seconds, open rally slots auto-fill from players with "Engage Offline" enabled:
- Helps when players momentarily focus elsewhere
- Ensures rallies reach capacity
- Reduces coordination burden during intense moments

**Strategic Application:**
- Enable during capital assault phases
- Critical rallies get filled automatically
- Players can focus on multiple activities simultaneously

### Multiple Simultaneous Marches

**Battlefield Presence Maximization:**

Players can deploy multiple marches:
- Hit different targets while troops deployed
- Some players rally capital
- Others farm HQs
- Maximizes individual and server effectiveness

**Coordination Prevents Overlap:**
- Target assignment lists critical
- Communication about who's hitting what
- Prevents multiple rallies on same weak HQ
- Efficient resource utilization

## Resource Management for Sustained Operations

### Speedup Conservation During Preparation Week

**Save for Saturday:**
- Avoid wasting speedups on non-essential upgrades before battle
- Every speedup saved = potential Saturday advantage
- Golden Hour optimization during prep week preserves combat resources

**Saturday Deployment Priorities:**

**Healing Troops:**

### Personal Score Optimization

**Target: 2.25 Million Points for All Nine Reward Chests**

**High-Yield Activities:**

**1. HQ Durability Farming (Highest Priority):**
- Target lower-level enemy bases (HQ 15-25)
- Minimal risk, high point return
- 360,000-520,000 points per full HQ destruction
- Doubled durability loss in capital zones
- Methodical farming generates massive points

**2. Capital Area Combat:**
- Best point multipliers
- Rewards whether troops kill or die
- Both activities generate personal points
- Strategic sacrifice acceptable

**3. Turret Zone Fighting:**
- Points for kills plus strategic value
- Elevated multipliers
- Tactical positioning important

**4. Enemy Troop Kills:**
- Inside capital: High yield
- Outside capital: Lower but accumulates
- Continuous engagement throughout battle

**5. Knockouts in Capital/Level 6 Zones:**
- +50,000 bonus points
- Significant bonus for HQ destruction in these zones

### Optimal Balance Strategy

**Force Allocation:**

**60-70% to Capital/Turret Operations:**
- Server victory focus
- Rally participation
- Capital reinforcement
- Turret holding

**30-40% to HQ Farming Parties:**
- Personal score generation
- Lower-risk point accumulation
- Methodical farming routes

**Dynamic Adjustment:**
- Rotate between roles every 30-60 minutes
- If victory appears secure: shift more to personal farming
- If victory uncertain: prioritize capital push
- Read battlefield dynamics continuously

**Individual Optimization Within Server Goals:**

Best players achieve both:
- Contribute to server victory through rallies/reinforcement
- Generate personal score through efficient HQ farming
- Balance activities based on battlefield conditions
- Adapt force allocation as situations evolve

## Zone Control Priorities

### Tier 1: Turrets (Critical)

**Capture Immediately at 12:00:**

**Strategic Value:**
- Only three turrets (capture race dynamics)

- Eliminate significant defending troops
- Require just 10 troops each (manageable commitment)
- Serve as forward operating bases

**Execution:**
- Assign specific alliances to each turret
- Clear responsibility prevents confusion
- Simultaneous capture attempts
- Maintain garrison after capture

### Tier 2: Capital Zone Contest

**Victory Condition Location:**

**100% Occupation Wins Instantly:**
- Station maximum 10 troops in capital building
- Maintain continuous pressure with waves
- Attacking HQs within capital produces doubled durability loss
- Both kills and deaths generate personal points

**Overwhelming Force:**
- Multiple coordinated rallies
- Continuous reinforcement rotation
- Accept casualties for progress advancement
- Strategic sacrifice for victory condition

### Tier 3: Level 6 Zones

**Elevated Point Bonuses:**

**Secondary Farming Locations:**
- Less contestation than capital center
- Enhanced point multipliers
- Use as fallback when capital too crowded
- Knockout enemies for +50,000 bonus points

**Tactical Flexibility:**
- Alternative high-value zones
- Reduced defensive pressure
- Efficient point generation

### Tier 4: Scattered HQ Targets

**Personal Score Generation:**

**Lower-Level HQ Farming (15-25 Ideal):**
- Easy targets with minimal resistance
- High personal point returns
- Farming routes through enemy territory
- Coordinate to prevent alliance overlap

**Execution:**
- Mark farmed HQs in alliance chat
- Prevent wasted attacks
- Methodical route planning
- Continuous farming throughout battle

## Advanced Invader Tactics

### Pre-12:00 Psychological Warfare

**Teleportation from 00:00-12:00:**

Visible presence creates defender anxiety:
- Mass teleportation shows invasion force size
- Defenders see invader positioning
- Psychological pressure builds before combat
- Forces defensive preparation during "safe" window

**Scouting and Intelligence:**
- Identify defender force distribution
- Locate heavily defended vs weakly defended areas
- Mark priority targets
- Gather intel for tactical planning

### Feint and Misdirection

**Create Multiple Threat Vectors:**

Position forces suggesting multi-pronged attack:
- Eastern force threatening one turret
- Western force threatening another
- Central force near capital
- Defenders must spread to counter all threats

**Execute Where Defenders Weak:**
- Concentrate actual attack on weakest point
- Other positions serve as feints
- Exploit defensive gaps
- Overwhelming local superiority

### Rotation and Relief

**Never Commit All Forces:**

Stagger attacks maintaining continuous pressure:
- Wave 1 attacks while Wave 2 heals
- Wave 2 attacks while Wave 1 heals
- Sustained pressure without exhaustion
- Defenders face constant engagement

**Fresh Troops Always Available:**
- Emergency response capability
- Tactical flexibility
- Prevent complete force depletion
- Sustainable operations

### Home Defense During Offensive

**Critical Balance:**

Never leave home capital undefended:
- Defenders may counter-attack invader home state
- 20-30% of forces remain home defense
- Rotate offensive players through defensive duty
- Communication essential for crisis response

**Emergency Recall Protocol:**
- If home capital attacked heavily
- Recall offensive forces using free teleportation
- Defend home first, then resume offense
- Invader mobility enables rapid response

The Invader role rewards aggression, coordination, and tactical flexibility. Success requires exploiting free teleportation for concentrated strikes while maintaining defensive vigilance and resource sustainability throughout the four-hour battle.
