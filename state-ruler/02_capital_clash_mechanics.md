# State Ruler - Capital Clash Mechanics

**[← Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)** | **[← Preparation Phase](01_preparation_phase.md)**

---

Saturday's Capital Clash transforms Preparation Phase results into direct PvP combat. This four-hour battle (12:00-16:00 UTC) determines tournament winners through capital occupation and point accumulation.

Understanding the battle mechanics is essential—hospital management, zone control, and teleportation restrictions create the tactical landscape where coordination determines victory.

## Battle Timeline

### Saturday Schedule

**00:00 UTC - Invaders Can Teleport:**
- Invaders gain ability to teleport into defender territory
- 12-hour preparation window before combat begins
- Time for positioning, scouting, target marking, coordination

**12:00 UTC - Capital Protection Drops:**
- Capital buildings and turrets exit protection mode
- Four-hour battle window begins
- All combat mechanics activate

**16:00 UTC - Battle Ends:**
- Occupation percentages locked
- Victory determined by 100% achievement or highest percentage
- No combat activities count after deadline

This compressed timeline creates intense pressure where every decision matters and wasted time directly impacts outcomes.

## Zone Types and Strategic Values

The battlefield divides into distinct zones with dramatically different strategic values and point multipliers.

### Capital Center

**Highest-yield location** with best point multipliers for all combat activities:

- Maximum occupation progress contribution
- Both troop kills AND deaths generate personal points
- Primary victory condition location

### Turret Zones (3 Total)

**Critical tactical structures** surrounding capital:

- Three turret positions available
- Elevated point generation for combat
- Each turret accepts maximum 10 troop garrisons
- **Enemy-controlled turrets fire at capital** every 60-300 seconds
- Each turret shot wounds 2% of capital garrison troops
- Maximum 8% garrison damage per cycle with all four turrets held

**Strategic Value:**
- Control turrets to damage enemy capital automatically
- Prevent enemy from controlling turrets attacking your capital
- Forward operating bases for rally staging
- Elevated combat point multipliers

### Capital Area and Level 6 Zones

**Enhanced point bonuses** above normal territory:

- Better combat point multipliers than outer areas
- +50,000 bonus for HQ knockouts in these zones
- Troop kills and deaths both generate points
- Secondary farming locations with less contestation

### Outer Areas

**Standard point values** throughout remaining territory:

- Normal combat point generation
- HQ farming locations (especially lower-level targets)
- Resource gathering after victory
- Fallback positions when capital too contested

### Point Multiplier System

**HQ Durability Destruction:**
- Base: **10 points per 1 durability point reduced**
- Full HQ destruction: **360,000-520,000 points** (depending on 36,000-52,000 durability range)
- **Critical:** HQs destroyed within capital zones suffer **doubled durability loss**
- Effectively doubles point generation speed in capital areas
- Additional **+50,000 bonus points** for HQ destruction in Capital/Level 6 areas

**Combat in Designated Zones:**
- Both kills AND deaths generate personal points in capital/turret zones
- Strategic sacrifice acceptable when fighting in high-value areas
- "Sometimes sacrifice brings reward" - points earned even through losses
- Encourages aggressive capital defense over passive positioning

## Capital Occupation Mechanics

### Occupation Progress System

**Core Mechanism:**
- Progress bar requiring **continuous troop presence** in capital buildings
- Four primary structures: Capital building + three turrets
- Each structure accepts **maximum 10 troop garrisons**
- Total garrison capacity: 40 commanders (10 each across 4 structures)

**Progress Advancement:**
- Maintaining forces in positions advances occupation toward 100%
- Continuous presence required - troops must stay garrisoned
- Attacking capital without garrisoning doesn't advance occupation
- Both sides can advance occupation percentage simultaneously

### Victory Conditions

**Two Paths to Victory:**

**Instant Victory:**
- First state to reach **100% capital occupation wins immediately**
- Contest ends the moment 100% achieved
- No need to wait until 16:00 UTC

**Percentage Victory:**
- If neither reaches 100% by 16:00 UTC deadline
- State with **highest occupation percentage wins**
- Even 51% vs 49% determines victory
- Creates defensive strategy of maintaining percentage lead

### Turret Impact on Capital Defense

**Devastating Attrition Mechanic:**

Every 60-300 seconds, each enemy-controlled turret fires at capital:
- **2% of garrisoned troops wounded per turret per shot**
- Multiple turrets stack damage
- Maximum 8% garrison damage per firing cycle (all four turrets held)

**Example Scenarios:**

Defender holds all turrets:
- Capital garrison suffers NO automatic damage
- Invaders must rely purely on direct attacks

Invaders hold 2 turrets:
- 4% capital garrison damage per firing cycle
- Manageable with steady reinforcement rotation

Invaders hold all 4 turrets:
- 8% capital garrison damage per cycle
- Unsustainable attrition requiring constant rotation
- Defenders must recapture turrets or face collapse

This mechanic makes turret control absolutely critical - they continuously damage enemy capital without requiring ongoing attacker commitment.

### Garrison Mechanics

**Garrison Limitations:**
- Maximum 20 commanders per capital structure/turret
- Each commander contributes up to 10 troops
- Total: 200 troops maximum per structure (20 × 10)

**Garrison Stats:**
- Garrisoned troops use garrison owner's stats during defense
- Strong player positioning crucial for defensive effectiveness
- Players garrisoning buildings cannot join other rallies
- Cannot garrison multiple buildings simultaneously
- Requires rotation for offensive participation

**Strategic Implications:**
- Strong defenders garrison capital/turrets
- Weaker players focus on rallies and support
- Continuous rotation between defense and offense
- Communication essential for garrison management

## Teleportation Mechanics

### Invader Teleportation

**Advantages:**
- **Free unlimited teleportation** into defender territory
- Starts at Saturday 00:00 UTC (12 hours before combat)
- Constrained only by small cooldowns between jumps
- No diamond cost (normally 500-1,500 diamonds)

**Requirements:**
- All troops must be home (no active marches)
- No active attacks when teleporting
- Small cooldown between consecutive teleports

**Return Home:**
- Click server display at screen top
- Teleport back to home state
- Same free teleportation applies

**Strategic Value:**
- Saves tens of thousands of diamonds across battle day
- Enables rapid repositioning and concentrated strikes
- Withdraw from unfavorable engagements without cost
- Choose battle timing, locations, target selection

### Defender Teleportation

**Absolute Restrictions:**
- **Defenders CANNOT teleport to enemy states under any circumstances**
- No diamond option, no alternative methods
- Purely defensive positioning within home territory
- Can only engage invaders who enter their state

**Compensating Factors:**
- No teleportation cost since already home
- Home field advantage in familiar territory
- 300% reinforcement march speed boost (when controlling territory)
- Faster response to threats within own state

### Tactical Asymmetry

The teleportation disparity creates fundamental tactical differences:

**Invaders:**
- Mobility and initiative control
- Strike anywhere, anytime
- Exploit defensive weaknesses
- Attack during enemy offline periods
- Dictate battle tempo

**Defenders:**
- Reactive positioning only
- Respond to enemy movements
- Cannot strike enemy home state
- Must defend within own territory
- Rely on coordination and positioning

This mobility gap means invaders choose engagements while defenders react to enemy initiatives.

## Rally Mechanics

### Rally Basics

**Setup and Timing:**
- Five-minute setup timer (standard)
- Capacity determined by rally leader's Rally Square level
- Rally leader provides primary hero skills/stats
- Joiners contribute "Expedition Skill" (top-right skill slot)

**Participation:**
- Rally leader initiates and leads
- Other players join (up to capacity limit)
- "Engage Offline" feature auto-joins after 60 seconds if slots open
- Helps coordination when players momentarily focus elsewhere

### Capital Structure Rallies

**During State Ruler:**
- Each capital structure/turret accepts **maximum 10 troop garrisons**
- Creates clear defensive capacity limits
- Multiple coordinated rallies can overwhelm garrisons

**Timing Strategy:**
- Coordinate multiple rallies 1-2 seconds apart
- First rally hits full defenders
- Second rally encounters depleted resistance
- Overwhelms defender rotation timing

### Advanced Rally Tactics

**Ghost Rallies:**
- Rally targets PvE objective (Furylord, world boss)
- If enemies capture building before rally arrives
- Rally bounces off (PvE vs PvP targeting mismatch)
- Skilled coordinators use for rapid recapture:
  - Set ghost rally targeting PvE
  - Capture building
  - Rally immediately reinforces

**Hero Composition:**
- Rally leader: Primary skills and stats affect entire rally
- Joiners: Expedition Skill contributions only
- Optimal mix: Offensive joiners (Jesse +25% damage) + defensive joiners (Sergey durability boost)

**Limitations:**
- Chiefs occupying towers/capital cannot join other rallies
- Cannot garrison additional buildings while in rally
- Strategic choices about force deployment required

### Rally vs Solo Attacks

**Rally Attacks:**
- Best for: Harder targets (HQ 25+, heavily garrisoned)
- Advantages: Combined strength, coordinated damage
- Disadvantages: 5-minute setup, coordination required

**Solo Durability Hits:**
- Best for: Weak targets, fast execution
- Advantages: No coordination delays, rapid farming
- Disadvantages: Limited effectiveness vs strong targets

Choice depends on target strength and available coordination.

## Shield Mechanics and War Frenzy

### Peace Shield Usage

**Shields Remain Usable During State Ruler:**

Available shield types:
- 8-hour Peace Shield
- 24-hour Peace Shield
- 3-day Peace Shield

**Purchase Locations:**
- City Walls menu (direct diamond purchase)
- Alliance Shop (Individual Credits)
- Item Shop/Black Market (diamonds for warehouse storage)

**Strategic Applications:**
- Shield before teleporting when troops deployed
- Protect HQ when farming parties are out
- Coordinate unshielding when ready to engage
- Emergency protection when hospital approaching capacity

### War Frenzy Combat Buff

**Activation Method:**
- Start an attack on any player
- Immediately recall troops (don't need to travel or engage)
- Action triggers War Frenzy buff for **10 minutes**
- Provides damage bonuses during combat

**Buff Characteristics:**
- Duration: 10 minutes
- Requires reactivation for continuous maintenance
- **Only rally leaders trigger War Frenzy** - participants do not
- Activating just before major battles optimizes combat effectiveness

**Strategic Timing:**
- Activate before important rallies
- Reactivate every 10 minutes during sustained combat
- Coordinate activation timing with offensive pushes
- Remember to maintain during critical capital attacks

### War Frenzy Shield Blocking

**Critical Limitation:**

**War Frenzy blocks shield usage for 15-30 minutes** after combat:
- Base duration: 15 minutes
- Extends based on HQ level (up to 30 minutes at higher levels)
- Players cannot activate shields until War Frenzy completely expires

**Vulnerability Window:**
- After attacking, cannot immediately shield
- Creates exposure period where opponents can counter-attack
- Must wait for War Frenzy expiration before shield protection available

**Tactical Implications:**
- Plan shield timing around War Frenzy cooldowns
- Cannot shield immediately after combat participation
- Coordinate attacks knowing you'll be vulnerable afterward
- Keep emergency recall available if War Frenzy prevents shielding

## Hospital Mechanics and Permanent Loss

### Hospital Capacity System

**Primary Death Prevention Mechanism:**

Under normal conditions with hospital capacity remaining:
- All casualties become **wounded troops** sent to Emergency Hospital
- Healing costs: Food, wood, metal, gas
- No permanent deaths if hospital capacity available
- Hospital capacity varies by level (60,000 troops typical)

### The Permanent Loss Rule

**CRITICAL MECHANIC:**

**When hospitals reach full capacity:**
- **70% of overflow troops transfer to enlistment office**
- **30% DIE PERMANENTLY**

This verified mechanic from State of Survival Capital Clash (Last Z uses nearly identical system) makes hospital management the **single most critical survival factor**.

**Example Calculation:**

Hospital capacity: 60,000 troops
Total casualties: 70,000 troops
- First 60,000: Go to hospital (can be healed)
- Remaining 10,000 overflow:
  - 7,000 troops (70%) → Enlistment office
  - 3,000 troops (30%) → **DIE PERMANENTLY**

**Why This Matters:**

Permanent troop deaths are devastating:
- Months of training lost instantly
- Resources spent training wasted
- Combat effectiveness reduced permanently
- Cannot be recovered through any means

### Emergency Hospital (HQ 22+)

**Additional Safety Net:**

Emergency Hospital unlocks at HQ 22:
- Provides additional capacity for "fainted units"
- Secondary capacity when primary hospitals fill
- Reduces permanent losses by rescuing percentage of overflow
- Still subject to same 30% permanent death for true overflow

### Hospital Capacity Management

**Prevention Strategies:**

**Monitor Capacity Religiously:**
- Check hospital percentage constantly during combat
- Yellow/orange warnings indicate approaching capacity
- Never let hospital reach 100% without immediate action

**Strategic Withdrawal:**
- Consider withdrawal when approaching 80-90% capacity
- Better to disengage and heal than lose 30% permanently
- Tactical retreat preserves long-term combat capability

**Research Investment:**
- "Fully Armed Alliance" tree increases hospital capacity substantially
- Each research level adds significant capacity
- Priority research before major events

**Continuous Healing:**
- Don't wait for hospital to fill
- Heal continuously throughout combat
- Batch healing strategy (explained below)

## Troop Healing and Reinforcement Rotation

### Healing Mechanics

**State Ruler Death System:**
- **No troop deaths for casualties within hospital capacity**
- Healing management paramount over training new troops
- Four-hour battle window demands continuous healing cycles

**Resource Costs:**
- Healing requires: Food, wood, metal, gas
- Costs scale by troop tier (T9 cheaper than T11)
- Economic incentives for fielding appropriate tier troops
- Pre-event stockpiling essential (millions of resources needed)

### Batch Healing Strategy

**Critical Technique for Sustained Combat:**

**The Method:**
1. Submit small batches with **one-hour healing times** for alliance help requests
2. Alliance members click help buttons → **instant healing** of batch
3. Repeat cycle continuously during active combat
4. Maintains troop availability while preventing hospital overflow

**Why This Works:**
- Alliance Help instantly completes small batches
- Much faster than waiting for natural healing timers
- Members earn alliance credits for helping
- Enables continuous combat rotation

**Execution:**
- Submit batches of 50-100 troops
- Set for 1-hour healing times
- Request alliance help immediately
- Coordinate with alliance for emergency healing during intense periods

### Reinforcement Rotation Strategy

**Continuous Cycle:**

Deploy → Fight → Hospital → Heal → Redeploy

**Rotation System:**
- Keep 2-3 formations ready while one heals
- Never commit all forces simultaneously
- Stagger rotations so fresh troops always available
- Coordinate with alliance for gap coverage

### Turret Damage Compound Effect

**Attrition from Enemy-Held Turrets:**

Each enemy turret wounds 2% of capital garrison every 60-300 seconds:
- 1 turret held: 2% attrition per cycle
- 2 turrets held: 4% attrition per cycle
- 3 turrets held: 6% attrition per cycle
- 4 turrets held: 8% attrition per cycle

**With All Turrets Under Enemy Control:**
- 8% garrison depletion per firing cycle
- Unsustainable without constant rotation
- Defenders must continuously send fresh reinforcements
- Rotate wounded troops out for healing immediately

This compounds healing demands - turret control directly impacts hospital management and reinforcement sustainability.

### Talent Point Reset Strategy

**Two-Phase Talent Management:**

Maintain **two Talent Point Resets** for switching:

**War Talents (Combat Phases):**
- Maximum attack/defense bonuses
- Combat stat optimization
- Active during capital attacks/defense

**Eco Talents (Healing Phases):**
- Accelerated healing speeds
- Resource production bonuses
- Active when healing hospital casualties

**Strategic Application:**
- Switch to War talents before major battles
- Switch to Eco talents when hospitals approaching capacity
- Accelerates healing to prevent overflow and permanent losses
- Two resets allow flexibility throughout four-hour battle

### Resource Pre-Stockpiling

**Essential Pre-Event Preparation:**

**Healing Resources:**
- Food: Millions needed for sustained healing
- Wood: Significant quantities required
- Metal: Substantial stockpiles essential
- Gas: Often limiting factor - stockpile 200+ minimum

**Combat Resources:**
- Healing items (speedups, instant heals)
- Troop training speedups for replacements
- Peace shields for emergency protection
- Speedups for rapid reinforcement

**Why Stockpiling Matters:**
- Four-hour sustained combat consumes enormous resources
- Cannot gather effectively during battle
- Running out mid-battle forces withdrawal
- Victory often determined by resource depth

## Critical Mechanics Summary

**Most Important Systems:**

1. **Hospital Management:** 30% permanent death on overflow - monitor religiously
2. **Turret Control:** Auto-damages enemy capital, controls attrition rates
3. **Teleportation Asymmetry:** Invader mobility vs defender positional advantages
4. **Occupation Progress:** Continuous garrison presence required for victory
5. **Zone Multipliers:** Capital combat worth dramatically more points
6. **Rally Coordination:** Overwhelm defenses through timed multiple rallies
7. **Batch Healing:** Alliance help system enables sustained combat rotation

**Common Fatal Mistakes:**

- Letting hospital overflow (30% permanent loss)
- Ignoring turret control importance
- Not rotating reinforcements continuously
- Failing to stockpile healing resources
- Committing all forces without reserves
- Missing War Frenzy activation before key battles

Understanding these mechanics transforms chaotic Saturday battles into coordinated tactical execution. The side that masters hospital management, turret control, and reinforcement rotation gains decisive advantages regardless of raw power differences.
