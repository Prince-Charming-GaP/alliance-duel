# State Ruler - Preparation Phase

**[← Back to General Introduction](00_general_introduction.md)**

---

The Preparation Phase runs Sunday through Friday (six days) and determines which server becomes the advantageous Invader versus the reactive Defender. This phase rewards consistent daily participation and strategic resource timing over sporadic effort.

**The Stakes:** Server with higher total points becomes Invader (free teleportation, initiative control). Lower-scoring server becomes Defender (positional advantages only).

## Point Earning Categories

The Preparation Phase operates through three distinct point categories that sum together for your server's total score.

### Individual Points

Personal achievement activities that accumulate across six days:

**Alliance Duel Daily Ranking:**
- Rank 1: **6,000 points per day**
- Accumulates daily (6 days × 6,000 = 36,000 points potential)
- Requires dominating your alliance's Alliance Duel participation
- Consistency matters more than single-day excellence

**Arena Champion:**
- First place: **20,000 points**
- Awarded once per Preparation Phase
- Substantial reward making final ranking push valuable
- Strategic timing: attack during last 3 minutes when revenge buttons disappear

**Full Preparedness Champion:**
- First place: **500 points**
- Lower value but still contributes
- Bonus for already completing Full Preparedness activities

**Enemy Supply Truck Plundering:**
- **100 points per successful plunder**
- Unlimited opportunities throughout Preparation Phase
- Attack only enemy state trucks (not your own server!)
- Use "Hide trucks of this State" filter to show enemy targets only
- Compounds across hundreds of players into thousands of state points

### Alliance Points

Coordinated team effort through Alliance Duel competition:

**Alliance Duel Victory:**
- **30,000 points per win**
- Six opportunities (one per day)
- Maximum potential: 180,000 points if winning all six days
- Requires 20+ members coordinating resources and timing
- Substantial reward emphasizing collective action over individual glory

This makes Alliance Duel the single highest-value activity during Preparation Phase. Alliances winning consistently give their server decisive point advantages.

### State Points

Server-level competition through Furylord boss battles:

**Furylord Cumulative Damage:**
- **Only top 200 players' damage counts** toward state total
- All top 200 contributions add to server score
- Spawns four times daily: 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 Apocalypse Time
- Remains active for 180 minutes per spawn
- Each player gets four attacks per spawn
- Only highest single damage hit counts for individual ranking

**Furylord Top Damage Bonus:**
- Highest individual damage dealer: **30,000 point bonus**
- Creates elite player competition for bonus slot
- Drives top player engagement and optimization

**Furylord Optimization Tips:**
- Ensure strongest 200 players participate in all four daily spawns
- Research attack bonuses outweigh defense for boss damage
- Coordinate timing so top players don't miss spawns
- Individual competition for 30k bonus drives elite engagement

### Total State Score Formula

**Simple Addition:**

```
Total State Score = Individual Points + Alliance Points + State Points
```

This straightforward calculation means every action matters. Even 100-point truck raids compound across hundreds of players into substantial state totals. A server with strong Alliance Duel coordination but weak Furylord participation can still win through collective effort.

## Invader vs Defender Role Assignment

### How Roles Are Determined

**Pure Performance-Based:**
- Server with **higher total Preparation Phase points becomes Invader**
- Server with **lower total points becomes Defender**
- NOT random, NOT power-based
- Purely earned through six days of accumulated activities

### Example Matchup

From community sources:
- **Server A:** 172,600 total points → **Invader**
- **Server B:** 116,800 total points → **Defender**
- Gap: 56,000 points demonstrating cumulative impact of daily performance

This ~48% point differential shows how consistent preparation advantages compound. Server A likely dominated Alliance Duel victories, maintained strong Furylord participation, and coordinated truck hunting effectively.

### Role Impact on Saturday

**Invader Advantages:**
- Free unlimited teleportation into enemy territory
- Choose when, where, and who to attack
- Attack any unshielded player regardless of location
- Dictate battle tempo forcing reactive defender responses
- Strike during enemy offline periods

**Defender Advantages:**
- Home field advantage in familiar territory
- No teleportation costs (already positioned defensively)
- 300% reinforcement march speed for rapid response
- Default capital ownership (invaders must reach 100%)
- TVT combat in capital generates points whether winning or losing

The Preparation Phase determines these roles—making daily participation critical for securing advantageous positioning.

## Optimal Preparation Strategies

### The Golden Hour Concept

**Key Principle:** When Full Preparedness theme overlaps with Alliance Duel theme, actions count for BOTH events simultaneously—effectively doubling reward value.

**How Full Preparedness Works:**
- Runs in six 4-hour cycles daily with rotating themes
- Each cycle offers three task chests: 1,500 / 4,000 / 12,000 point thresholds
- Themes rotate through vehicle, shelter, science, hero, army expansion
- **Theme 3 (8:00-12:00 and 20:00-24:00) ALWAYS matches Alliance Duel day**

**Strategic Application:**
- Stockpile speedups, hero fragments, upgrade materials all week
- Deploy ONLY during optimal windows matching both events
- Major construction during Shelter Upgrade day + Full Preparedness overlap
- Research during Age of Science day + Full Preparedness overlap
- Hero upgrades during Hero Initiative day + Full Preparedness overlap

This timing discipline transforms normal activities into doubled reward generation.

### Alliance Duel Coordination

**Six Daily Themes:**
- **Day 1 (Monday):** Modded Vehicle Boost - Golden wrenches, vehicle upgrades, radar events
- **Day 2 (Tuesday):** Shelter Upgrade - Construction speedups, bounties, recruitment
- **Day 3 (Wednesday):** Age of Science - Research speedups, badges, intercity trade
- **Day 4 (Thursday):** Hero Initiative - Hero fragments, exclusive equipment, power cores
- **Day 5 (Friday):** Holistic Growth - Troop training, any speedups, power gains
- **Day 6:** (Not during Prep Phase - Saturday is Capital Clash)

**Coordination Strategy:**
- All alliance members save resources for correct days
- Deploy major upgrades on matching theme days
- Focus on orange-tier tasks only (10-100x more points than lower tiers)
- Use Golden Hour windows religiously
- Target Alliance Duel victories (30,000 points each) as highest prep value

Winning even 4 of 6 Alliance Duel days = 120,000 points for your server. This single coordinated effort can decide Invader/Defender roles.

### Supply Truck Hunting Strategy

**Target Identification:**
- Attack **only enemy state trucks**, never your own
- Use "Hide trucks of this State" filter for enemy-only display
- Enemy trucks show up across the world map

**Execution:**
- 100 points per successful plunder seems small individually
- Unlimited hunting opportunities throughout six days
- Compounds across server: 100 players × 20 successful raids each = 200,000 points
- No resource cost except march time

**Optimization:**
- Scout routes through enemy-populated areas
- Coordinate in server chat to avoid overlapping same trucks
- Hunt during off-peak hours when less competition exists
- Use fast march heroes to maximize raids per hour

This "small" activity becomes substantial through server-wide participation. Don't dismiss 100-point activities—they compound into decisive advantages.

### Arena Champion Push

**Value:** 20,000 points for first place makes final ranking push worthwhile

**Tactical Execution:**
- Attack during **last three minutes** when revenge buttons disappear
- Minimizes counter-attack windows
- Use diamonds for extra attempts only when legitimately competitive
- Don't waste resources on impossible climbs

**Strategic Timing:**
- Monitor top rankings throughout Preparation Phase
- Identify when you're competitive for champion (usually top 5-10 range)
- Make final push Thursday-Friday when rankings solidify
- Coordinate with server leadership if multiple top players exist

If your server has 2-3 players competitive for Arena champion, rotating who wins across different weeks maximizes total server points over multiple State Ruler rounds.

### Furylord Optimization

**Participation Requirements:**
- Only top 200 players' damage counts
- All 200 contributions add to state total
- Individual bonus (30,000 pts) goes to highest single damage

**Attack Mechanics:**
- Four daily spawns at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 Apocalypse Time
- 180-minute active window per spawn
- Four attacks per player per spawn
- Only highest single hit counts for individual ranking

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Ensure your strongest 200 participate in ALL four daily spawns
- Research attack bonuses outweigh defense for boss damage
- Use War talents and attack buffs during attempts
- Coordinate server-wide so top 200 never miss spawns
- Elite players compete for 30k bonus through max damage optimization

**Communication:**
- Server leadership announces Furylord spawn times
- Remind top 200 players in server chat before each spawn
- Track participation to identify who's missing spawns
- Adjust strategies if participation drops below 200 players

Even if your top player doesn't win individual bonus, having 200 participants maximizes state's cumulative damage points.

## Week-Long Preparation Discipline

### Daily Participation Consistency

**Day 1 (Sunday):**
- Alliance Duel Day 1 (Vehicle) - coordinate for victory (30k points)
- First Furylord spawns (4 opportunities)
- Begin truck hunting immediately
- Arena participation starts

**Days 2-5 (Monday-Thursday):**
- Alliance Duel continues (different themes each day)
- Four Furylord spawns daily (consistent participation)
- Continuous truck hunting
- Arena battles building toward final push
- Full Preparedness Golden Hour exploitation

**Day 6 (Friday):**
- Final Alliance Duel day (Day 5 - Holistic Growth)
- Last Furylord spawns of Preparation Phase
- Final truck hunting opportunities
- Arena champion final push (last 3 minutes strategy)
- Ends at Friday Apocalypse Time

**Result Determination:**
- Friday evening: Total points calculated
- Invader/Defender roles announced
- Saturday preparation begins based on assigned role

### Resource Timing Discipline

**Don't Waste Before Preparation Phase:**
- Save speedups, fragments, materials week before State Ruler starts
- Avoid unnecessary upgrades/research in lead-up week
- Stockpile resources for optimal Golden Hour deployment

**During Preparation Phase:**
- Deploy resources ONLY during matching theme days
- Use Golden Hour windows when both events overlap
- Focus on orange-tier activities exclusively
- Save combat resources for Saturday (don't waste on non-essential PvP)

**Saturday Preparation:**
- Conserve healing items and shields for Capital Clash
- Stockpile food, wood, metal, gas for sustained healing
- Keep troop speedups for rapid reinforcement
- Save diamonds for emergency shields/teleportations

The servers that win Preparation Phase aren't necessarily strongest—they're most disciplined about resource timing and consistent daily participation.

## Common Preparation Mistakes

**Skipping Daily Events:**
- Thinking "I'll do extra tomorrow" doesn't work
- 6,000 points missed Monday can't be recovered Tuesday
- Consistency compounds: 6 days × 6,000 = 36,000 total
- Even small daily contributions (truck raids) compound into thousands

**Poor Alliance Duel Coordination:**
- Individual excellence doesn't equal alliance victories
- 30,000 points per win requires 20+ coordinated members
- One player scoring high while others don't participate = loss
- Winning 4 of 6 days = 120,000 point swing

**Improper Resource Timing:**
- Using speedups/fragments outside theme days wastes double-reward potential
- Golden Hour overlap can turn 100k points into 200k+ points
- Patience during Preparation Phase determines Saturday success

**Neglecting "Small" Activities:**
- 100-point truck raids seem insignificant individually
- 100 players × 10 raids each = 100,000 points
- 500-point Full Preparedness champion adds up
- Every contribution counts toward role determination

**Top 200 Furylord Participation Gaps:**
- Missing spawns permanently loses those cumulative damage points
- If only 150 players participate instead of 200, significant point loss
- Communication gaps cause missed spawn opportunities
- Elite player competition for 30k bonus drives engagement

**Burning Out Before Saturday:**
- Using ALL resources during Preparation Phase
- Nothing left for Saturday healing/combat
- Victory requires sustained effort through full event

## Preparation Phase Mindset

**Think Server-Wide:**
- Your individual contribution matters regardless of power level
- Truck raids, event participation, coordination all compound
- Even 100-point activities become 10,000+ across server

**Prioritize Alliance Duel:**
- 30,000 points per victory = highest single value
- Requires coordination but pays massive dividends
- Winning 5 of 6 days can single-handedly secure Invader role

**Consistency Over Intensity:**
- Six days of moderate participation > two days of extreme effort
- Daily 6,000-point Alliance Duel ranks compound to 36,000 total
- Four daily Furylord participations required (can't make up missed spawns)

**Resource Discipline:**
- Stockpile before Preparation Phase starts
- Deploy only during optimal Golden Hour windows
- Save combat resources for Saturday
- Patience during preparation determines Saturday success

**Communication:**
- Server leadership coordinates Alliance Duel strategies
- Announce Furylord spawns before each window
- Share truck locations and hunting routes
- Celebrate daily victories to maintain momentum

The Preparation Phase isn't just six days of event grinding—it's a strategic battle to secure the advantageous Invader role that determines Saturday's tactical landscape. Servers winning Preparation Phase through discipline and coordination gain transformative advantages for Capital Clash.
