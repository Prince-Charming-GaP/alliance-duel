# Alliance Duel - Day 6: Enemy Buster

**Subject: Day 6 STARTS TODAY - Enemy Buster Strategy (PvP Combat Day!) ‚öîÔ∏è**

---

Hey team!

**IMPORTANT: Day 6 starts TODAY (Friday) at 6pm Server Time - NOT tomorrow!**

**Day 6: Enemy Buster** is the PvP combat finale of Alliance Duel. Unlike previous resource management days, this day rewards direct combat - but you can still score points even without fighting! Let me explain both strategies.

## What Gives Points Today/Tomorrow

### üî• COMBAT POINTS
1. **Defeating Enemy Alliance Units** - 24-136 points per unit (Tier 1-10)
2. **Fighting Enemy Alliance Members** - **2x points** (doubled when fighting opponent alliance!)
3. **Winner Bonus** - Winner always scores more than loser
4. **Loser Still Scores** - Even losing gives points (just fewer)

### üéÅ UNIQUE REWARDS
**Day 6 chests contain Valor Medals instead of hero fragments!**
- Up to 5,200 Valor Medals available (10,400 with Premium/Super Rewards unlocked)
- Trade medals for orange equipment in Merit Shop
- Makes Day 6 rewards uniquely valuable

## Three Strategy Options

You have three viable approaches for Day 6. Choose based on your power level, resources, and risk tolerance:

### Strategy 1: AGGRESSIVE COMBAT (Strong Players)

**Best for:** High power players, coordinated alliances, those with resources to spare

**What to do:**
1. **Attack enemy territories** - Lower points but no gas cost, troops return
2. **Farm weaker HQs** - Higher points, costs gas, risk troop loss
3. **Coordinate with alliance** - Mass attacks on enemy cities
4. **Capture enemy cities** - Up to 21% ATK bonus (7% per city)
5. **Capture main city** - 10 million alliance points!

**Territory vs Territory (TvT) Combat:**
- ‚úÖ Troops return after combat (no permanent loss)
- ‚úÖ No gas cost
- ‚úÖ Earn points from defeating enemy units
- ‚ùå Lower point values than HQ attacks
- **Best for:** Safer combat with no long-term costs

**HQ Farming:**
- ‚úÖ Higher point values per kill
- ‚úÖ Can gain resources from farms
- ‚ùå Costs gas
- ‚ùå Risk permanent troop loss
- ‚ùå High healing costs
- **Best for:** Strong players targeting weak opponents

### Strategy 2: DEFENSIVE PARTICIPATION (Medium Players)

**Best for:** Mid-power players, those low on healing speedups, cautious players

**What to do:**
1. **Use 24-hour shield** - Protects your base
2. **Join HQ as reinforcement** - Still earn points while shielded!
3. **Selective combat** - Only fight when odds are favorable
4. **Help alliance defense** - Reinforce allied territories/cities

**The Reinforcement Strategy:**
This is the SECRET strategy most players don't know!

- You can be shielded AND earn points
- Join an alliance member's HQ as reinforcement
- When enemies attack that HQ, YOU get points
- Your base stays protected under shield
- **Free points with zero risk!**

**How it works:**
1. Activate 24-hour shield
2. Reinforce a strong alliance member's HQ
3. When enemies attack them, you earn combat points
4. Your own base never gets attacked
5. Profit!

### Strategy 3: FULL DEFENSE (Weaker Players/Resource Conservers)

**Best for:** Lower power players, those saving for next week, minimal PvP interest

**What to do:**
1. **Activate 24-hour shield** - Prevents all attacks
2. **Stay shielded entire day** - Zero risk
3. **Accept lower chest rewards** - Trade combat points for safety
4. **Save resources for next week** - Start preparing for next Alliance Duel

**Why this is valid:**
- No troop losses
- No healing costs  
- No gas consumption
- Resources saved for next week
- Lower chest rewards, but your choice!

Some weeks aren't worth fighting (huge power gap, hopeless matchup). Shield and save resources for a winnable week.

## Combat Mechanics

### Point System:
- **Tier 1 troops defeated:** 24 points per unit
- **Tier 10 troops defeated:** 136 points per unit
- **Against enemy alliance members:** 2x multiplier (doubled points!)
- **Winner always scores more than loser**
- **Loser still scores something**

### Strategic Targets:

**High Value:**
- Enemy alliance members (2x point multiplier!)
- Weaker enemy HQs (easier kills, fewer losses)
- Enemy territories (safe combat, troops return)

**Medium Value:**
- Resource farms outside alliance (points but no multiplier)
- Neutral targets (if no better options)

**Low Value:**
- Your own alliance members (don't attack teammates!)
- Heavily shielded enemies (waste of attempts)
- Targets way above your power (certain defeat)

## City Capture Strategy (Advanced)

**For coordinated alliances only:**

**Benefits of capturing enemy cities:**
- 7% ATK bonus per city captured (up to 3 cities = 21% total!)
- Psychological impact on enemy
- 10 million alliance points for main city capture
- Shows dominance

**Requirements:**
- Coordinated alliance effort
- High power members
- Strategic timing
- Resources for sustained combat

**Most alliances:** Don't worry about city capture. Focus on territories and farming instead.

## Your Day 6 Action Plan

### BEFORE 6pm Server Time TODAY (Friday):
- [ ] Decide your strategy: Aggressive, Defensive, or Full Defense
- [ ] Check your healing speedups (do you have enough?)
- [ ] Check your gas supply (needed for HQ attacks)
- [ ] Prepare 24-hour shields if going defensive
- [ ] Coordinate with alliance in chat
- [ ] Position troops appropriately

### STARTING 6pm Server Time TODAY:

**If Aggressive:**
1. Scout enemy alliance members (find weaker targets)
2. Coordinate with alliance for territory attacks
3. Launch attacks during active alliance hours
4. Balance risk vs. reward (don't over-commit!)
5. Keep healing speedups ready

**If Defensive:**
1. Activate 24-hour shield
2. Join strong alliance member's HQ as reinforcement
3. Earn passive points when they get attacked
4. Stay safe, collect points
5. Celebrate smart strategy!

**If Full Defense:**
1. Activate 24-hour shield
2. Focus on preparing for next week
3. Accept lower chest rewards this day
4. Save resources for next Alliance Duel
5. No shame in this choice!

## What NOT to Do Today/Tomorrow

‚ùå **DON'T attack without checking power levels** - Easy way to lose troops
‚ùå **DON'T overcommit against superior opponents** - Accept some fights aren't winnable
‚ùå **DON'T attack your own alliance members** - Points only work against enemy alliance!
‚ùå **DON'T forget to shield** (if going defensive/full defense)
‚ùå **DON'T use resources saved for next week** - If matched badly, conserve for better weeks

## Competitive Targets

**Aggressive Players:**
- **Casual combat:** 500,000 - 1,000,000 points
- **Strong combat:** 1,500,000 - 3,000,000 points
- **Top fighters:** 4,000,000+ points
- **MVP candidates:** 6,000,000+ points

**Defensive Players:**
- **Reinforcement strategy:** 100,000 - 500,000 points
- **Limited combat:** 200,000 - 800,000 points

**Full Defense:**
- **Shielded:** 0 points (but zero losses!)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Attacking without scouting** - Walking into stronger opponents
2. **Not having healing speedups ready** - Massive healing costs without speedups
3. **Attacking during low alliance activity** - No backup when needed
4. **Forgetting Day 6 starts Friday 6pm** - Missing early combat opportunities
5. **Not considering reinforcement strategy** - Missing safe point opportunities
6. **Attacking randomly** - Target selection matters!
7. **Overcommitting in unwinnable weeks** - Sometimes shielding is smartest choice

## The Valor Medal Rewards

**Why Day 6 is unique:**

Normal days: Hero fragments in chests
Day 6: **Valor Medals** in chests

**Valor Medal value:**
- Trade for orange equipment in Merit Shop
- Premium equipment otherwise hard to acquire
- Makes Day 6 rewards worth fighting for

**Even if you score low, try to unlock some chests for the medals!**

## Alliance Coordination

**Critical for Day 6:**
- Communicate target selection in chat
- Call for reinforcements when needed
- Coordinate territory attack timing
- Share enemy scouting information
- Celebrate victories together
- Support each other through defeats

**Leadership roles (R4/R5):**
- Identify primary targets
- Coordinate mass attacks
- Call strategic retreats if needed
- Manage morale
- Make go/no-go decisions for risky fights

## The "Hopeless Week" Decision

**Sometimes matchmaking gives you an impossibly strong opponent.**

When this happens, smart alliances:
1. Recognize the power gap early
2. Coordinate resource conservation
3. Shield on Day 6
4. Save everything for next week
5. Accept this week as a strategic skip

**This is smart strategy, not giving up!**

Better to save resources for a winnable week than deplete everything in an unwinnable fight.

## Risk vs. Reward Analysis

**Aggressive Combat:**
- ‚úÖ High point potential
- ‚úÖ Valor Medal rewards
- ‚úÖ Team coordination excitement
- ‚ùå Troop losses
- ‚ùå Healing costs
- ‚ùå Gas consumption

**Defensive Participation:**
- ‚úÖ Moderate points (via reinforcement)
- ‚úÖ Protected base (shielded)
- ‚úÖ Lower costs
- ‚ùå Moderate chest rewards

**Full Defense:**
- ‚úÖ Zero risk
