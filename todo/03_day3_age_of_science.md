# Alliance Duel - Day 3: Age of Science

**Subject: Day 3 Tomorrow - Age of Science (THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY!) üî¨**

---

Hey team!

Tomorrow is **Day 3: Age of Science** starting at **7pm Server Time tonight**. This is **THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY** of Alliance Duel! Here's why: not only does this day have massive point potential from research and badges, but it's also when you should unlock Premium Rewards, Super Rewards, and One More Research - getting BOTH the unlock benefits AND massive points from the badge consumption itself.

## What Gives Points Tomorrow

### üî• MASSIVE VALUE
1. **Badge Consumption** - 40 points per badge (20,000 badges = 2,000,000+ points!)
2. **Research Speedups** - 30 points per 1-minute + 1 point per 10 tech power
3. **Orange S-Rank Intercity Trade** - Significant points per completion
4. **Tech Power Gains** - From research completion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NO VALUE
- Blue/Green/Purple Intercity Trade - **0 POINTS**
- A-Rank Intercity Trade (even if orange!) - **0 POINTS**
- Only **Orange S-Rank trucks** give points!

## THE CRITICAL STRATEGY: Research Premium/Super/One More Rewards TODAY

**This is the single most important decision in Alliance Duel!**

### Why Research These on Day 3?

**Benefit #1: Unlock Better Rewards**
- Premium Rewards ‚Üí Unlocks reward chests 4-6
- Super Rewards ‚Üí Unlocks reward chests 7-9
- One More Research ‚Üí Unlocks additional reward chest

**Benefit #2: MASSIVE Points from Badge Consumption**

These researches consume thousands of badges, and at 40 points per badge on Day 3, this generates enormous points!

**Example:**
- Premium Rewards costs ~5,000 badges
- 5,000 badges √ó 40 points = 200,000 points
- PLUS you unlock chests 4-6 forever
- **Same investment, double benefit!**

### Research Priority Order (Day 3):

1. **Event Expert** (+100% bonus points - DOUBLES everything!)
2. **Premium Rewards** (Unlocks chests 4-6 + badge points)
3. **Super Rewards** (Unlocks chests 7-9 + badge points)
4. **One More Research** (Extra chest + badge points)
5. **Incentive - Development** (+100% construction points - helps future Day 2s)
6. **Event King** (+200% bonus points - TRIPLES everything!)

**If you haven't researched Event Expert yet, start with that FIRST!** It doubles all your points going forward.

## Badge Consumption Strategy

**Badges are 40 POINTS EACH on Day 3!**

This is THE reason to save badges all week. Whether you spend them today or next week doesn't matter for your progression, but spending them during Day 3 gives you massive free points.

### How to Maximize Badge Points:

1. **Save ALL badges all week** (don't research badge-consuming techs Mon-Tue)
2. **On Day 3, research ONLY badge-consuming techs:**
   - Alliance Recognition tree (Event Expert, Event King, Premium/Super Rewards)
   - Hero Training techs
   - Military Strategies techs
3. **Use both research labs** - One on badge techs (for Day 3), one on non-badge techs (other days)

**Advanced Strategy:**
- Start expensive research late Day 2
- Finish with speedups on Day 3 Golden Hour
- Get speedup points + power points + Full Preparedness rewards simultaneously

## Intercity Trade Strategy

**ONLY Orange S-Rank Trucks Give Points!**

This is extremely strict:
- Orange S-Rank truck: ‚úÖ POINTS
- Orange A-Rank truck: ‚ùå 0 POINTS
- Blue/Purple/Green (any rank): ‚ùå 0 POINTS

### How to Get Orange S-Rank Trucks:

1. Open Intercity Trade
2. Check truck color AND rank
3. If not Orange S-Rank ‚Üí **Use trade contract to refresh**
4. Keep refreshing until Orange S-Rank appears
5. Complete ONLY Orange S-Rank trades

**Yes, this costs trade contracts and/or diamonds. It's worth it.** The point difference between Orange S-Rank and anything else is literally 100% (points vs. no points).

## Your Day 3 Action Plan

### BEFORE 7pm Server Time Tonight:
- [ ] Count your total badges (this is your point potential!)
- [ ] Save ALL research speedups (don't use today!)
- [ ] Check which Alliance Recognition techs you haven't researched yet
- [ ] Prepare trade contracts for intercity trade refreshing
- [ ] Note your current tech power

### STARTING 7pm Server Time:
1. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (Around 8:00 Server Time or before reset)
2. **Research Event Expert first** (if not already done)
3. **Research Premium Rewards** (unlocks chests 4-6 + massive badge points!)
4. **Research Super Rewards** (unlocks chests 7-9 + more badge points!)
5. **Research One More Research** (extra chest + badge points!)
6. **Research other badge-consuming techs** (Alliance Recognition, Hero Training)
7. **Use research speedups** to complete/accelerate research
8. **Refresh intercity trade for Orange S-Rank trucks**
9. **Complete Orange S-Rank intercity trades**

## Golden Hour Timing

**Tomorrow's Golden Hours:**
- **First window:** Around 8:00 Server Time (morning)
- **Second window:** Around 6:30pm Server Time (before reset)

**CRITICAL:** Starting research and using speedups during Golden Hour gives you:
- Alliance Duel points (research speedups + badge consumption)
- Full Preparedness rewards
- Tech power progression
- Chest unlocks (for Premium/Super/One More Rewards)

**This is 4x benefit from one action!**

## The Two-Lab Strategy

**Lab Strategy for Maximum Efficiency:**

**Lab 1:** Badge-consuming research
- Alliance Recognition (Day 3 focus)
- Hero Training (Day 3 focus)
- Military Strategies (Day 3 focus)

**Lab 2:** Non-badge research
- Shelter techs
- HQ Management
- Rapid Growth
- Development

This lets you save badges for Day 3 while still progressing in other areas during the week.

## What NOT to Do Tomorrow

‚ùå **DON'T complete non-Orange-S-Rank intercity trade** - Literally 0 points
‚ùå **DON'T use construction speedups** - Day 2 only!
‚ùå **DON'T spend hero fragments** - Save for Day 4!
‚ùå **DON'T train troops** - Save for Day 5!
‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches** - Day 1 only!
‚ùå **DON'T research non-badge techs today** - Save those for non-event days

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 2,500,000 - 4,000,000 points
- **Top performers:** 5,000,000 - 8,000,000 points
- **MVP candidates:** 10,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** Badge savings! Players with 20,000+ badges can easily score 2M+ from badges alone.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not researching Premium/Super/One More Rewards on Day 3** - Missing the double benefit!
2. **Spending badges on non-event days** - Wasting 40 points per badge
3. **Completing non-Orange-S-Rank trades** - Wasting trade opportunities for 0 points
4. **Using research speedups before event** - Losing massive point potential
5. **Not waiting for Golden Hour** - Missing Full Preparedness double rewards
6. **Researching non-badge techs on Day 3** - Save those for regular days

## The Badge Savings Reality

**"I only have 5,000 badges saved, is that enough?"**

YES! Here's the math:

- 5,000 badges √ó 40 points = 200,000 points
- Plus research speedup points
- Plus tech power gain points
- Plus intercity trade points

Even "small" badge savings create substantial scores.

**"I have 20,000 badges saved!"**

EXCELLENT! That's:
- 20,000 badges √ó 40 points = 800,000 points
- Just from badges alone
- Before any other activities!

This is why saving badges all week matters so much.

## Alliance Coordination

- Share in chat when you complete major research (morale boost!)
- Help teammates understand why Day 3 research unlocks are critical
- Coordinate timing for collective Golden Hour push
- Celebrate milestone research completions together

## Premium/Super/One More Rewards Investment

**"Should I really research these today?"**

**ABSOLUTELY YES, if you can!** Here's why:

**Short-term benefit:**
- Massive badge consumption points TODAY
- Helps alliance win THIS week

**Long-term benefit:**
- Unlocks higher reward chests FOREVER
- Every future Alliance Duel gives better rewards
- One-time investment, permanent benefit

**When to research:**
- Premium Rewards: ASAP if you can afford it
- Super Rewards: After Premium (higher badge cost)
- One More Research: After Super (extra chest benefit)

Even if you can only afford Premium Rewards this week, do it! The chest unlock is permanent.

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Things to use tomorrow:**
- ‚úÖ ALL badges (through badge-consuming research)
- ‚úÖ ALL research speedups
- ‚úÖ Orange S-Rank intercity trade trucks (refresh until S-rank!)

## Final Reminder

**Day 3 = Research Day = Badge Consumption Day = Chest Unlock Day**

This is the most important day because:
1. Badge consumption gives 40 points each (massive multiplier!)
2. You research Premium/Super/One More Rewards for permanent chest unlocks
3. You get points from both the badges AND the unlocks
4. Event Expert/Event King double/triple all your future points

**Strategy Summary:**
- Save ALL badges for today
- Research Premium/Super/One More Rewards TODAY
- Use ALL research speedups during Golden Hour
- Only complete Orange S-Rank intercity trades
- Research Event Expert/Event King if you haven't already

Tomorrow is our biggest scoring opportunity. Let's make it count! üî¨üöÄ
