# Alliance Duel - Day 4: Hero Initiative

**Subject: Day 4 Tomorrow - Hero Initiative Strategy (Hero Fragments Day!) ü¶∏**

---

Hey team!

Tomorrow is **Day 4: Hero Initiative** starting at **7pm Server Time tonight**. This is HERO DAY - when we use all saved hero fragments, recruitment tickets, power cores, and equipment materials. If you've been hoarding hero resources all week, tomorrow is payday!

## What Gives Points Tomorrow

### üî• HIGH VALUE
1. **Orange Hero Fragments** - 5,000 points each
2. **Orange Equipment Fragments** - 5,000 points each
3. **Prime Recruitment Tickets** - 500 points each
4. **Power Cores** - 400 points each
5. **Orange Skill Books** - 10 points per book consumed
6. **Hero Experience Consumption** - Points for leveling heroes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM/LOW VALUE
- Purple Hero Fragments - 1,700 points each
- Blue Hero Fragments - 500 points each
- Purple Equipment Fragments - 1,700 points each
- Blue Equipment Fragments - 500 points each

### ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
- **Consuming Orange Equipment as Promotional Material** - 300,000 points BUT terrible long-term value!

## The Hero Fragment Strategy

**Orange fragments are worth 10x blue fragments!**

### Point Comparison:
- 1 Orange hero fragment = 5,000 points
- 1 Purple hero fragment = 1,700 points
- 1 Blue hero fragment = 500 points

**Strategy: Save ALL hero fragments all week, use them ALL tomorrow!**

This includes:
- Hero fragments from any source
- Equipment fragments  
- Universal fragments
- All rarity levels

Whether you use them today or tomorrow doesn't change your hero progression, but using them tomorrow gives you massive free points!

## Equipment Fragment Strategy

**Same principle as hero fragments:**

- Orange equipment fragment = 5,000 points
- Purple equipment fragment = 1,700 points  
- Blue equipment fragment = 500 points

### What to Do:
1. **Use ALL equipment fragments tomorrow** (not today!)
2. **Upgrade equipment during the event** (gets points!)
3. **Don't craft equipment before event starts** (lose points!)

### What NOT to Do:
**DON'T consume orange equipment as promotional material!**

Yes, it gives 300,000 points. But you're destroying functional orange equipment that took months to acquire for a one-time point gain. Unless you have duplicate orange equipment you genuinely don't need, this is almost never worth it.

**Better strategy:** Use fragments to upgrade existing equipment instead.

## Prime Recruitment Tickets

**500 points per ticket = Free points for something you'd do anyway!**

- Save ALL prime recruitment tickets this week
- Use them ALL tomorrow
- Recruit during Golden Hour to potentially overlap with other events
- 20 tickets = 10,000 points automatically

Don't try to save tickets for "perfect" recruitment timing. The event points are worth more than waiting for specific heroes.

## Power Cores

**400 points per power core consumed!**

Power cores are used to level up heroes past certain thresholds. If you have power cores saved:

1. Wait until tomorrow to use them
2. Use during Golden Hour when possible
3. Level up heroes you actually use (don't waste on unused heroes just for points)

The points are a bonus for progression you'd do anyway!

## Skill Books

**10 points per orange skill book consumed**

This is lower value than other activities, but if you have skill books to use:

1. Save them for tomorrow
2. Use on heroes you actually use
3. Focus on higher-value activities first (fragments, tickets, cores)

Skill books should be your lower priority compared to fragments and tickets.

## Hero Experience Strategy

**Points awarded for consuming hero experience to level heroes**

Consuming 24 million hero experience typically unlocks all task chests, making this one of the easier days to complete.

### Strategy:
1. Save hero experience items all week
2. Tomorrow, level up heroes during event
3. Focus on heroes you actually use
4. Don't waste experience on unused heroes just for points

**Pro Tip:** If you have heroes close to level thresholds, wait until tomorrow to push them over!

## Your Day 4 Action Plan

### BEFORE 7pm Server Time Tonight:
- [ ] Count your hero fragments (all rarities)
- [ ] Count your equipment fragments
- [ ] Count your prime recruitment tickets
- [ ] Count your power cores
- [ ] Check which heroes need leveling
- [ ] Save ALL hero resources (don't use today!)

### STARTING 7pm Server Time:
1. **Wait for Golden Hour!** (Around 8:00 Server Time or before reset)
2. **Use ALL hero fragments** (orange > purple > blue)
3. **Use ALL equipment fragments**
4. **Use ALL prime recruitment tickets**
5. **Use ALL power cores** (on heroes you actually use)
6. **Consume hero experience** to level heroes
7. **Use skill books** (on heroes you use)
8. **Upgrade equipment** with fragments

## Golden Hour Timing

**Tomorrow's Golden Hours:**
- **First window:** Around 8:00 Server Time (morning)
- **Second window:** Around 6:30pm Server Time (before reset)

**Hero upgrades during Golden Hour = Alliance Duel points + potential Full Preparedness rewards!**

If Full Preparedness has hero-related tasks, you'll complete both simultaneously.

## What NOT to Do Tomorrow

‚ùå **DON'T consume orange equipment as promotional material** (unless you have genuine duplicates)
‚ùå **DON'T use construction speedups** - Day 2 only!
‚ùå **DON'T use research speedups** - Day 3 only!
‚ùå **DON'T train troops extensively** - Save for Day 5!
‚ùå **DON'T use golden wrenches** - Day 1 only!
‚ùå **DON'T level heroes before event starts** - You lose all points!

## Competitive Targets

- **Casual participation:** 800,000 - 1,500,000 points
- **Strong contribution:** 2,000,000 - 3,500,000 points
- **Top performers:** 4,000,000 - 6,000,000 points
- **MVP candidates:** 8,000,000+ points

**Key Factor:** How many orange fragments you've saved! Just 50 orange hero fragments = 250,000 points.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using fragments before event starts** - Losing thousands of points per fragment
2. **Consuming valuable orange equipment** - 300k points isn't worth destroying good gear
3. **Not waiting for Golden Hour** - Missing potential double rewards
4. **Upgrading heroes on wrong days** - Day 4 is the ONLY day that counts
5. **Wasting resources on unused heroes** - Focus on heroes you actually use

## The Fragment Hoarding Reality

**"How many fragments should I have saved?"**

Any amount helps! Here's the math:

**Small savings (50 orange fragments):**
- 50 √ó 5,000 points = 250,000 points
- Plus tickets, cores, and experience
- Easy to reach 500k-1M total

**Medium savings (150 orange fragments):**
- 150 √ó 5,000 points = 750,000 points
- Plus other activities
- Easily 1.5M-2M total

**Large savings (300+ orange fragments):**
- 300 √ó 5,000 points = 1,500,000 points
- Just from fragments!
- 3M+ total score achievable

Even if you only saved 20-30 fragments, that's still 100,000-150,000 free points!

## Priority Order for Tomorrow

**If you have limited time, prioritize in this order:**

1. **Orange hero fragments** (5,000 points each - highest value!)
2. **Orange equipment fragments** (5,000 points each)
3. **Prime recruitment tickets** (500 points each - quick and easy)
4. **Power cores** (400 points each)
5. **Purple fragments** (1,700 points each)
6. **Hero experience consumption** (level up heroes)
7. **Blue fragments** (500 points each)
8. **Skill books** (10 points each - lowest priority)

Focus on high-value activities first!

## Alliance Coordination

- Share major hero upgrades in chat (morale boost!)
- Celebrate when teammates unlock new heroes
- Help newer players understand fragment prioritization
- Coordinate Golden Hour timing for collective push

## The Equipment Consumption Decision

**"Should I consume my orange equipment for 300k points?"**

**Short answer: Almost never.**

**Only consume orange equipment if:**
- You have genuine duplicates (2+ of the same orange item)
- The equipment is for a hero you'll NEVER use
- You've carefully considered long-term vs. short-term value

**In 99% of cases:** Keep your orange equipment! The 300k points aren't worth months of lost functionality.

**Better alternatives:**
- Use fragments instead (same progression, points without loss)
- Focus on tickets and cores (free points with no downside)
- Save equipment for actual use on your heroes

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Things to use tomorrow:**
- ‚úÖ ALL hero fragments (orange, purple, blue)
- ‚úÖ ALL equipment fragments
- ‚úÖ ALL prime recruitment tickets
- ‚úÖ ALL power cores (on heroes you use!)
- ‚úÖ Hero experience items (to level heroes)
- ‚úÖ Skill books (on heroes you use)

**Things to save:**
- üíæ Training speedups (Day 5)
- üíæ Combat resources (Day 6)
- üíæ Any speedups not yet used (Day 5)

## Final Reminder

**Day 4 = Hero Day = Fragment Day**

The strategy is simple:
1. **Save ALL hero-related resources all week**
2. **Use ALL of them tomorrow during Golden Hour**
3. **Focus on orange fragments for maximum points**
4. **Don't destroy valuable equipment for points**

Whether you upgrade heroes today or tomorrow doesn't change your progression - but tomorrow you get massive free rewards for the same actions!

This is one of the easier days to score well if you've been disciplined about saving fragments. Let's make those hoarded fragments count! ü¶∏üí™
